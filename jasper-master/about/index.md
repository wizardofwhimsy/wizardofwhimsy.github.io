Debra Lynn is an author/illustrator who lives in the very scenic small town of Port Alice at the northern end of Vancouver Island.  Her first childrenâ€™s picture book, Marshmallow, about her very lazy cat who finds many creative ways to sleep, was published in 2013.  Her next picture book, Macaroni and Mud, about making a play feast out of all kinds of gross and yucky stuff, is slated to come out soon.

Debra Lynn grew up in the northern farming community of Athabasca, Alberta, but has spent many years travelling around the world, including too places like China, Mexico and Europe.  She has a BFA from the University of Alberta and an MA in art education from Concordia University, Montreal.  Besides working as a community art instructor, she also worked 18 seasons as a forest fire lookout in Northern Alberta and the Rocky Mountains.  Since moving to Port Alice in 2010, she has taken up kayaking for the first time with her partner James Moore and his cute little Chihuahua named Chloe.  Debra writes about their kayaking adventures in her blog:  www.chloethekayakingchihuahua.com.
