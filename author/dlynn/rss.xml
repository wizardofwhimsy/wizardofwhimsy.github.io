<p>Because I had to work and wasn’t available for kayaking, James decided to paddle the inlet on his own. Chloe stayed at home. James would end up having plenty of company anyway. He launched at the transfer station around noon. Not a good time to launch—and he would pay for it later! It was a bit cloudy, so the water was calm. With the tide flooding into the inlet, he paddled easily south toward the marina and the Frigon and Walk Out Islands. James was contemplating visiting his friend and old work buddy, Russell Inglis, who lives on the other side of the inlet, when suddenly, in the quiet of the cloudy day, he heard a sound that made him think that the ocean had sneezed! </p>

<p>Startled, he looked around for the source of the explosive sound. About 200 to 300 metres away from him, a whale had surfaced and was putting on a good show. It did some shallow dives, breached up, arched its tail and then went into a deep dive, not coming up for 4 or 5 minutes! It was a very surreal experience, out on the ocean with another animal the size of an airplane! When writing up this post, I asked James if he felt a sense of connection with the whale. He put down his cell phone and developed a quizzical expression. After a few seconds of silence, he answered, “I guess so. It was just him and me on the water.” James took some pictures, but they were taken after the breaching and didn’t do justice to the whole experience.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post9-whalesitting/the_whale.jpg" alt="Whale Sitting"><em>The whale.</em></p>

<p>I find it curious how there are so many videos of kayakers encountering whales without incident. Sometimes they even come within a hair’s breath of the kayak, without even rocking the boat. It is amazing that such massive creatures can be so careful and exacting in their movements, demonstrating a basic respect for diminutive creatures like us—as well as a certain playfulness. Like the seals and the sea lions, they like to tease and flirt. </p>

<p>James carried on to Russell’s place. First his dog came out to meet him, then Russell came to check out the commotion. Russell is an always jovial guy with a a very off-handed sense of humour and permanent devilish gleam in his eye. His property is an acreage on the underpopulated side of the inlet. His family gets many of their needs met from the land, having gardens, chickens, goats and access to prime fishing from the inlet. Even though they live in a fairly remote secluded place, it doesn’t prevent them from going out and about. When the family goes to the Legion Thursday nights for darts league, they often go by boat!  The whole family, including the in-laws, are all dart sharks and usually go home with prize money from tournaments quite consistently! I got paired up with Russell in a doubles tournament once and we won first prize! See, that’s how good of a dart player he is: that he can be paired up with a greenhorn like me and win! I wasn’t doing too badly that night, though, and got in some lucky shots at the right time that helped keep us out in front. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post9-whalesitting/russell_inglis.jpg" alt="Whale Sitting"><em>Russell Inglis.</em></p>

<p>Russell gave James a tour of the property. He showed him his sawmill, an old jeep that he was working on, and some of the things left by his father that he was planning to fix and sell. He introduced James to the goats and chickens, showed him a little greenhouse that he built, then showed him his son’s place a little further up the hill that was close to the finishing stages of construction. They then went into the house for a coffee and a beer. Like every conversation in town as of late, after talk about family and acquaintances, there is discussion about whether or not the mill will reopen. The visit was topped off by a trip in Russell’s skiff to his special fishing spot where they pulled up a large steel and very heavy crab trap full of crabs. Bringing the crabs back to the dock, Russell put some in a live well and processed a couple for James to put in his little kayaking cooler for the trip back.  </p>

<p>After leaving Russell’s little North Island oasis, James Paddled directly across the inlet. He received another greeting from his buddy, the whale, hearing a blow hole on the west side of the inlet, in the direction of the mill. By this time, it was getting sunny. The wind was picking up and blowing in his face. Paddling was getting a lot harder. His arms were getting tired, so he took a break in a little bay near Walk Out Island.  As soon as he left the protection of the Frigon Islands, the wind intensified. He contemplated pulling into the marina and walking back to the truck on the other side of town. In the end, he decided he was due for a work out, and he <i>definitely</i> got one! For about three kilometres he paddled with all his might, not getting very far very fast. He thinks he was paddling 6 or 7 knots, and going back 3. For those of you who are land lubbers, a knot is equivalent to almost two kilometres per hour. At the last little bit, he had to crank up the intensity to be able to get anywhere at all. Needless to say, he was happy to see his landing spot. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post9-whalesitting/port_alice_pulpmill.jpg" alt="Whale Sitting"><em>The Port Alice Pulp Mill.</em></p>

<p>Sitting on the shore, he took some time to recoup his strength and evaluate how many parts of his body were sore…but the wind wasn’t done with him yet! To add insult to injury, he had to wrestle with the wind as he struggled to mount the kayak on top of the truck all by himself. </p>

	     <p><b>August 4, 2015</b></p>

<p>Gooding Cove turned out to be our “adventure of misadventure”—and the misadventures were on straight out of the gate! On our way to the Wild West Coast, we followed Marine drive around the south end of Neroutsos inlet. Because I was so busy with my several part time jobs, I had to leave the research of how to get there all to James. I was blissfully tuned out as he was navigating. He followed the instructions in the BC Coast Explorer, telling us to follow Cayuse Main. We took a turn on Cayuse Main, driving for quite a while on a very undeveloped road, until, after coming up on a couple of fallen trees, James said a despondent “something’s wrong.” I was inclined to start chopping, but, as I later learned, the road to the Wild West Coast was a well enough travelled road that it should have been clear. We put our heads together and studied the book and the maps and figured out the <i>BC Coast Explorer</i> probably had a typo. We turned around and went back to Marine Drive. We followed it until it “became” Teeta Main (no turns taken) and just continued on. We then felt we were on the right track. </p>

<p>So, if you’re going the Wild West Coast, do not take Cayuse Main! It would probably lead you there eventually, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you happen to be driving a bull dozer! Just follow Marine Drive until it <i>becomes</i> Teeta Main. After that, follow the rest of the instructions in the <i>BC Coast Explorer</i>. As we were driving along Teeta Main, looking for the switchback that was supposed to be 25 km from Port Alice, checking out this side road and that side road and wondering if that was it, what did we come across but a great…big…LOGGING TRUCK! James turned very white! He shifted the truck into reverse and goosed it! Luckily, the logging truck had been slowing down to make a turn from a side road onto Teeta Main, and he was able to stop in time. It was obviously a little bit sooner than he expected, as his cab bucked up and down harshly from the abrupt deceleration. Realizing the logging truck had stopped, James shifted the truck into drive and goosed ahead! As we made our getaway, he informed me that our bacon was probably saved by the other pick up trucks that had passed us earlier, warning the logging truck drivers over the two way radios about a couple of yahoos with kayaks. </p>

<p>I have mentioned this before, but I will mention it again: if you don’t have the foolhardiness to travel on logging roads while the logging trucks are working, avoid travel between 6 am and 6 pm on weekdays. There are many stories around the Island of people who were seriously injured and even killed meeting up with a logging truck. Because logging trucks have the right of way, they are not even liable if they run into you. Some roads are not too bad, such as this one to Gooding Cove and Side Bay, as they are quite wide and have enough room to let two vehicles pass—in most places at least! It helps that James is familiar with logging roads, but I’m going to push for travel after 6 pm from now on, when feasible. If you come from a place where logging roads are a remote concept, you should travel during the safe hours, or better yet, hire a local to guide you. The village office/tourist information centre can give you some good leads. There is talk in Port Alice about having bus tours to Side Bay and Gooding Cove, but the idea is still in the “contemplative” stages at this time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/forestdirectionsigns.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Forest Direction Signs.</em></p>

<p>You might notice that on one of the signs in this photo, it says there is logging activity seven days a week. I’m not sure what to say about that, as there was a much greater preponderance of signs saying there is activity only on weekdays. Also, there is a mantra going around Port Alice that says “loggers keep banking hours.” In our travels, we haven’t seen any activity on weekends. I do know, that on the road to Link River, gravel trucks travel seven days a week and we need be careful about that. I’d say that travel on the weekends is generally safe, but, as with everything in life, there might be exceptions. Keep your eyes peeled at all times anyway. </p>

<p>We finally came across the switchback as described in <i>BC Coast Explorer</i>, and were heading up on K500, then on K main over the mountain pass. From K Main, we went on I main, then J main. As we got closer to the Wild West Coast, there were bold red and white hand painted signs pointing the way to Side Bay and Gooding Cove (I guess if you managed to make it this far, you finally earned the right to know where you’re going) so we were able to put down our books and maps. The road was pretty good in some places, and it even became a two lane highway in one stretch. It turned out to be a nice drive for a while. All the forks in the road had direction signs…except for one…and that was a problem! </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/road_show.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Let’s get this show on the road.</em></p>

<p>After we passed LeMare Lake we came across a fork in the road with a sign post that didn’t have a sign. We pondered and debated which one to take. We took the road to the right, thinking that the cove would be just on the other side of the ridge. It <i>definitely</i> turned out to be the road less travelled….to our chagrin! As we were driving, it struck me that it seemed like we were going up, but we couldn’t tell for sure because the trees were masking our surroundings. I started turning to a Nervous Nellie, complaining that this road was giving me a bad feeling. We debated and debated, but kept wondering what was behind the next rise. We drove up one rise only to find another one, which lead to another debate about whether or not we should take it. By the time we were certain we were on the wrong path, we were greeted by a spectacular panoramic view of the Quatsino Sound! </p>

<p>We found ourselves on a mountain cut block and quite nearly at the very top! We stopped at a little pull-out (emphasis on the “little”) because I really had to get out. My Nervous Nellie jitters turned into a full blown panic attack. I got out of the truck and didn’t care if I had to walk all the way down! Even so, I still grabbed the camera and took numerous shots of the incredible view! I couldn’t conceive how anyone could turn around on that narrow road with not much of a pull out, but somehow James did it! When I got back to Port Alice, I told one of my bosses, Rhetta Vesna at the Ozzieland Campground, about this. She informed me that she and her husband, Ozzie, ended up doing the very same thing back in the day…except, they didn’t just have a measly little pick up truck…they had a truck and trailer! Somehow they lived to tell about it! Rhetta says that’s probably why she has heart trouble today!</p>

<p>At the bottom, we took the other fork, crossed the bridge over Lamere River and passed by a rock slide that gave us cause to pause. On Restless Main, we passed Harvey Cove, stopping a couple times to take pictures. Arriving at Gooding Cove, we met a couple of campers and had a chat with them before setting up. They warned us not to drive on the sandy beach with our 2-wheel drive. They suggested instead that we camp on a ledge at the side of the cove that was close to the road. To camp on the beach would have meant too much walking with our heavy gear, so we agreed that the ledge was the solution. We mentioned we were bloggers and got quite a reaction. They suddenly got horrified looks on their faces and begged us to not tell anyone about this place. How’s <i>that</i> an endorsement for you! I figure if only a handful of people know about places like this, they may end up getting used for some less than aesthetic purpose. The more people that know about places like Gooding Cove, the more likely they will be preserved and protected. </p>

<p>After setting up camp, we went for a walk along the beach. We contemplated going for a paddle, but we were too burnt out from the trip. We spent the night sitting around the campfire, watching the flames and not saying very much. Perhaps we were clearing our minds in preparation for the next day’s misadventures. </p>

<p><b>August 5, 2015</b></p>

<p>It rained all night. Luckily, it was a fairly light rain. James got up in a frenzy in the middle of the night. Our tent had become the location of a new mini lake! We had a tarp under the tent (as well as over), but part of it was extending past the tent, catching water and causing it to flow down the slight slope and straight under our air mattress!  After James went out and made some adjustments to our tarps, we fell back to sleep. We woke up again around 8 am to the sound of raindrops hitting our tarp and waves crashing down below. </p>

<p>We opened the tent to find a miserable day out there, but it was only drizzling, not pouring. We contemplated what we should do, even considering going back home. We certainly felt frustrated enough to do so. The whole discussion was resolved by us falling gently back to sleep. When we got up at about 10:30, James opened the tent and peeked outside and proclaimed a couple of spots of blue sky. We felt hopeful. We took our time getting up, starting a campfire in the drizzle. The clouds seemed to anchor themselves just over the cove and the sun stayed out at sea. After a while, the clouds started to shuffle back and forth over the shore, causing the weather over us to alternate between drizzle and sunshine. I did my forest fire lookout weather forecasting and determined we had a short window of opportunity. I was a bit rushed, feeling we had to go soon or we would be going home unkayaked, but James wanted to deal with our wet clothes and the water problem in our tent. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/anchor_clouds.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Clouds anchored over the cove.</em></p>

<p>We lassoed a couple of saplings to make a clothes line. When I went into the tent to clean it out, it felt like a sauna. I removed all the clothes, putting the wettest ones on the line to half dry in the drizzle. We put our semi dry stuff and critical sleeping bags in the truck, so at least they wouldn’t get wetter. I lifted out the air mattress, finding a significant body of water. I took out the mattress and flipped it over so it could dry out in the occasional bits of sunshine. After soaking up what I could with a towel, I lifted the tarp off of the window in the back of the tent to create some air flow. I tied open the front entrance and left the tent to dry out…somewhat. </p>

<p>James and I quibbled over the campfire again. We put the bucket of water we had on it, but it was still smoking. I wanted to put another bucket on it, but he accused me of being over the top with this fire thing. He then told me to get the bucket myself. So I did. I found the wash water from last night and put that on the fire, but it was still smouldering. I went down the long way around the rocks to get more water. As I was getting my water, I looked up at James sitting on the camp chairs, and he didn’t look too happy. As I came back up the hill, he started walking down to the beach with the stuff for our kayaking trip, still very disgruntled. </p>

<p>After I satisfied myself that the fire was sufficiently out, I met him at the kayaks. There was one more fire that needed to be put out. James eventually apologized for getting mad at me. I told him, that I wouldn’t feel very comfortable out there kayaking knowing that the fire wasn’t completely out. Since he’s a pipe fitter, I told him it would be like him fixing a pipe and leaving a very small leak. He seemed to connect with the metaphor. Although the air above ground was wet on this day, the ground underneath, with all the dried leaves and other organic matter that is the “fuel” for a forest fire, was very dry. The rain was only wetting the ground’s surface and not sinking in very far. I could quite literally “feel” the dryness beneath me. I might have seemed “over the top” because the weather was so miserable. After eighteen seasons of taking weather calculations and seeing how they affect fire behaviour, I wasn’t fooled by the light rain. We had been having a long dry summer: it would take several days of heavy rain to bring the hazard down to safe levels. Even then, you should still be vigilant about putting out your campfires. As I explained in my Link River post, fires have ways of burning in low hazard, over a long cold snowy winter, and even underground for a hundred years or more!</p>

<p>It seemed to be a rough start to the day all over. Dozy and uncoordinated, we carried the kayaks down to the shore to about the middle. We had Chloe in the kayak and were sort of lined up to launch—except I wasn’t in it yet. As I was trying to push the kayak onto the water and hop in, a big wave came in and landed on Chloe! She had such a look of ultimate betrayal in her face! I thought she was going to hate us forever! We both felt like terrible parents! Chloe’s blankets were soaked, and she was soaked! I picked her up in my arms and cuddled and consoled her a while in some dry blankets while we tried to figure out what to do next. We considered everything, from giving up to going to the quieter part of the cove. We thought about switching kayaks but, in the end, James decided to go in the water a little and pull me out. He probably shouldn’t have been in the front of my kayak.  When it came time for me to paddle like a demon, I accidentally smacked him in the head with my paddle (take that for not letting me put out my campfire!) Alas alack, Chloe and I made it out past the breakers without getting soaked. I apologized profusely for smacking James, but he didn’t look like he was in too much pain because he was laughing. 
On the water, I couldn’t find my pedals. We had to paddle to a quieter part of the cove and get me adjusted (something we should have done before we launched). The big differential between the highs and the lows of the water level was giving me a bad case of turn-backitis; but, as soon as we were on the water, James was in charge and we were going. Sounding very professorial, he instructed me to avoid certain rocks, larger swells and breakers. Because it seemed like he knew what he was doing, I followed faithfully. At the mouth of the cove, paddling on the open ocean, we saw a wave farther out that was a huge fan of water splashing up 3 metres or more! The rocks the helped produce it were hiding stealthfully just below the surface of the water! I hate to think what would have happened to us if we were anywhere near there! We navigated between the spot with the scary wave and the rocks with the breakers, going up and down, up and down on the big swells. Finally, James paddled out ahead to check things out around the point and I stayed back. After he had a good look, he waved at me to follow. Swallowing my prairie chicken fear, and strongly resisting the temptation to go straight back to the shore, I did as he ordered. He told me to go slow and take my time. </p>

<p>After a short stretch on rocky open ocean, we soon found ourselves in a tranquil cove with plenty of rock formations and islands. Staying close to shore, we snapped pictures and reveled in the beauty of the rocks, the islands and the marine life. James was looking for a cabin that was built by a friend of his that was supposed to be somewhere there. We saw a cabin, but it turned out to be someone else’s. Before heading there, we took the roundabout route, paddling between the rocks and islands. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/smoothpaddling.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Smooth paddling.</em></p>

<p>Passing over calm waters between two rocks in between two islands, I felt my kayak suddenly rise up! I screeched at James, but it wasn’t enough warning. I rose about a metre into the air, but managed to avoid a splashing! Instead, James, who was little ahead of me, got swamped! It was a rogue wave! I remembered that when I paddled up to the rocks and looked out at the ocean, I could see no sign of waves for at least a kilometre! That mischievous wave had sneaked into the cove incognito, suddenly appearing under us the very moment we were passing between the two innocuous rocks. One is inclined to thing there was some kind of intelligence at work here! Thankfully, Chloe didn’t get swamped a second time, as she was in the Manitou with me. James, on the other hand, had to pull out the bilge pump. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/flat_water.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Don’t let this flat water fool you!</em></p>

<p>On the way to the cabin, we said hello to Mr. Jellyfish and took some pictures. At the cabin, we delighted in using a real outhouse! We saw a folding chair sitting under a bunch of fishing floats hanging in the trees. The cabin looked nice on the outside, but it was very bare bones on the inside. The walls were made of unpainted particle board and it had few furnishings, essentially a big shelf full of cots. We found a guest book that had been written in extensively, possibly over the space of decades. I didn’t spend too much time reading, but noticed one passage where the guests had to contend with rats. Because it was cool and dreary inside, we went outside to have our snack. We walked around the beach and checked out the rocks. We found wild strawberries growing high up on a couple of large rocks on shore, their tiny habitat being high enough to be safe from the tides and waves.  </p>

<p>We left the cabin and paddled to the point to check out Restless Bight to the south. James went out ahead of me to scout but, seeing high winds and a lot of breakers, he called off the attempt. On our way back, a large seal or sea lion had some fun with the tourists. He did a flip out of the water behind us, causing a noisy splash and making us jump. 
That rogue wave must have seriously spooked James. As we were going back around the point back to Gooding Cove, he was ahead and I was well behind. I was taking my time, because he told me to do that before. He started complaining about my slow pace, so I geared into my warp drive paddle. We rounded the point, riding high swells and keeping our eyes on the breakers further out to sea. Perhaps James realized we could easily be hit by a rogue wave again; but, on the open ocean, it would have been a lot more devastating! It was probably only the luck of the draw that we didn’t. The water was turbulent probably because of the stormy weather. On a calm sunny or generally overcast day, the trip might not be so risky. </p>

<p>I was glad when the point was behind us, but we still had to ride high swells all the way back to the shore. We decided to go far to the right on the beach that was more protected. The waves weren’t that bad by then though, and we probably could have landed in the centre. We walked back, looking for a walking stick for me because my knee was bugging me. As we were sitting on a log and looking at the bay and our kayaks, it occurred to me that we should name our kayaks. Calling them by their product name was a little too formal. </p>

<p>We got a fire going again—which was really hard because it was so wet (I wonder whose fault that is!)—and cooked up all our remaining meat, including steak and pork chops. We sat by our campfire watching it burn and listening to the crashing of the waves. I so love doing nothing sometimes!</p>

<p><b>August 6, 2015</b></p>

<p>It was dry in the morning, but we kept sleeping in our tents. As I was laying there, I contemplated the naming of our kayaks. I thought about naming the Eskia “Donovan Bailey” or “Andre Degrasse” because it was the fast one. Because the Manitou sounded like Manitoba, I thought about naming it after Winnipeg, as like in Winnie the Poo. Then I thought about the characters in Winnie the Poo. I thought, because the Manitou was the slower steady kayak, it should be named “Eeyore.” Then it occurred to me that we should name the Eskia “Tigger,” because it was the fast bouncy kayak. James had a laugh and seemed to agree. From then on, our kayaks were named Eeyore and Tigger. It is probably very apropos, since I’m a children’s author, and James is a children’s author’s boyfriend, who, by the way, is also a remarkably kid friendly person. We don’t have too many disagreements on how to deal with children (like we do about putting out campfires). </p>

<p>By the time we were out of our tent, it was raining steadily. James went to get the kayaks to put them on the truck. I stayed back and dismantled the tent. Even though we hadn’t started a fire that morning, when James wasn’t looking, I dumped some water on our campfire pit. Even though it didn’t look like it was burning and it was raining lightly, the fire pit hissed like a pit of snakes! Even <i>I</i> was surprised by this! That fire looked dead, but it was full on alive! </p>

<p>As we were packing up, our neighbours left and some new campers came by. We were worried that my two-wheel drive would not be able to make it up the road in the rain. We asked the new possible campers to look out for us. It was a good thing, as it turned out they were just about to leave. I got out of the truck to lighten the load. James made it up, giving a happy toot when he made it to the top. Otherwise, we might have been stuck there a few days!  </p>

<p>We were planning to go to Side Bay for at least a quick look, but, because of the rain, we felt an urgency to get back. James left the final decision to me and I decided against. James later said it was a good thing, because, if we had gone there, we would have been coming back late at night, which, on long lonely logging roads, is not a pleasant notion—especially if we suddenly find ourselves on the top of a mountain with nowhere to turn around! </p>

<p>Driving back, we kept hearing a strange noise. I thought it was my differential (I forgot I used to have problems with it). After stopping a few times, we finally figured out it was because I didn’t twist the straps that hold the kayaks and it was causing “harmonic vibration.” In fact, I tried to make them especially flat and straight because I thought it was more aesthetic…silly artsie me! Alas alack, it wasn’t my differential! After fixing the straps by giving them a few twists, we continued on the slow long two and a half hour journey in the rain along logging roads J, I and K. Every once in a while, we had to stop to adjust our foam pads that kept falling out of place, as well as have a listen for the rumble of logging trucks in the distance. </p>

<p>Going over the mountain pass we took to get there, we found it much scarier than the trip the other way. There were no guard rails and we had a full on view of the very steep drop! Going up we were oblivious, as that scene was behind us. We inched along. I had to look away to avoid a panic attack. James was very cool, but I could tell he wasn’t at ease about it either. </p>

<p>Relieved to be past the scary part, we stopped at an overgrown campsite just below the pass and took pictures of the mill across the inlet. It’s funny how the mill, such a massive complex that is such a big part of people’s lives in Port Alice, looks so miniature in the expanse of nature! It makes you realize how the entity that created nature has a lot more resources and a lot more influence in the larger scheme of things. As we drove along Marine Drive, it was interesting to watch it change from a rough forestry road to a municipal paved road lined with signs, houses and pruned and trimmed lawns and shrubs. </p>

<p>I went to my place and had a good nap, my cats sleeping on top and beside me. They quite evidently missed me as much as I missed them. Later, I cleaned myself up a little and went down the hill to James’ place to have some grub. </p>

	  <title>Cluxewe Resort: The Big Gamble</title>

	     <p><b>July 7, 2015</b></p>

<p>James wanted to take his daughter kayaking, but we realized we couldn’t go anywhere too remote. We opted for Cluxewe Resort, just a turn and a short drive off Highway 19. If you are travelling from the south, it is 12.2 kilometres north of Port McNeill, and then a turn to the right. There is a big Cluxewe Resort sign at the turn off, so it is hard to miss. </p>

<p>I stayed with the cats the night before and got a lot of cleaning and garden watering done. I watered everything: the flowers in front, the pots, and the vegetable garden. I even left the hose on mist for a good long time in strategic places like the zucchini planter, the blueberries, the rhubarb, etc. Except between the hours of 12 and 4, I was watering all day and well into the night with the misting hose. You’d think I was living in the desert instead of the rainforest! It’s getting to be that way, little by little. It was a good thing I put down some grass clipping mulch to hold in the moisture. I left the balcony for the morning, did my house-sitting job and then went down to James’ place. We hit the road, James in my truck with the two kayaks, and I in the Camry with his daughter, Tyra, and her friend in the back connected to their media devices. As we drove along, I met a very slow logging truck, a bear (which the girls didn’t see because they were in that other “media dimension”) and a mama deer and her two babies. The baby Bambis hooves were proportionally larger than their growing bodies. Running away from the car they were leaping awkwardly, looking not quite as graceful as Mama. I couldn’t help but think they looked like kids trying to move fast in their mother’s oversized high heel shoes.  </p>

<p>We went to the campsite we reserved but we weren’t happy with it. It was narrow, with not much greenery and lots of traffic driving by to the islet. James took the bike and went on a tour around half the campsite. When he returned, we took the car to the islet and checked out some other camping spots. We really liked 54, but wrote down some other numbers just in case. When we got to the office, we found out 54 was reserved starting tomorrow until September! We ended up in 100, just across from 54. When we were unloading at site 100, I wasn’t much help, as I had trouble sleeping the night before. I did my usual duty, and set up the tent and the air mattress. Once that was done, I collapsed onto the air mattress and slept for a good part of the afternoon. 
James woke me up and put the end of Chloe’s leash in my hand so he and the girls could go kayaking. Though I was barely awake, I noticed that the particular sound of the waves meant they were getting rough. I got up and had a couple of iced teas in my folding chair with Chloe on my lap, struggling to get myself fully awake. When I finally got up to go to the bathroom, James was coming down the road. He told me their trip was cut short by the waves (tell me something I didn’t know!). They had some trouble coming in with the surf and Tyra ended up getting splashed. At first Tyra wanted to go to the lighthouse, but James vetoed it. They said they had fun bobbing up and down, but they didn’t feel like kayaking for very long. It seems like the girls had fun, but got bored with kayaking pretty quickly. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post8-cluxewe/tyra.jpg" alt="Cluxewe"><em>Tyra</em></p>

<p>In the evening, we grilled steaks on the BBQ because there was a fire ban. I complained that we did not have lemon juice and olive oil for the grilled vegis. I’m very persnickety about following recipes to the letter. James often makes fun of me because I won’t go “outside the box” when I cook. I often answer back that I go “outside the box” in just about every other aspect of my life, so I’m allowed. I went toward the office to see if there was a store, but there was only a restaurant. James offered me some olive oil based margarine and butter and I took it, but we couldn’t find a substitute for lemon juice. I was having a crisis! I was so bothered by not having lemon juice, I ended up going to Port McNeill the next day to get it and a few other things.  </p>

<p>James and I went for a bike ride around the campsite, then followed a path into the woods that lead us to the river, a huge pile of water worn rocks and a trail on the beach. We parked our bikes and sat on a log for a while, watching the scenery and musing. We went walking along the beach for as long as my knee could stand it. I thought of Hawaii and how it is very much like this, exotic, but just a lot warmer. James expressed a wistful desire to go to Hawaii someday. I wasn’t interested in Hawaii at first, because I thought it was probably too touristy. When I got there though, after spending a winter in China and Hong Kong, I was actually impressed. I stayed there a couple of months in ‘83, living in a Philipino lady’s apartment with a Swiss roommate and a whole lot of cockroaches. One of those cockroaches was nearly the size of my hand and had sneaked into my bikini bottoms when they were hanging to dry on the closet pole. It gave me quite the scare when I gathered my stuff for a day of snorkeling at Hanauma Bay!
With no campfire to sit around because of the fire ban, I asked the girls if they would be interested in playing poker. They didn’t know how, so I offered to teach them. I first taught them the hands, from lowest to highest, then we played a few practice rounds. We then we had a rousing game well into the night, our table lit with several battery-operated lanterns. </p>

<p>After we finished the game, James and I retired to our tent. As soon as we were in, the girls pulled the poker chips out again and started playing between themselves. While James and I were reading by flashlight, we had to shout out the answer to the occasional poker related question. </p>

<p><b>July 8, 2015</b></p>

<p>We got up around 10, expecting the girls to follow suit not long after…but no such luck. In fact, when we came back from our kayaking trip that day, they were still asleep! I forgot what teenagers were like! 
The other times we kayaked, Chloe whined a lot on the water. This time, however, she whined to get <i>into</i> the kayak! She didn’t whine at all when we were on the water! She is probably so used to kayaking now, that she would probably feel lost without it. It would be much harder for her to stay home alone all day with only a couple of visits from a dog-sitter. Even though she is well into middle age, she is very much a baby at heart and has to go everywhere with Mommy and Daddy! </p>

<p>Following the tide going out, James and I kayaked close to shore in the direction of the estuary. We paddled in the fog, feeling calm, and not inclined to paddle too hard. The estuary water was very shallow. We realized we weren’t going to get too far in at low tide. We decided instead to paddle into the fog, staying close to the shore so as not to get lost and inadvertently paddle out to sea. It’s quite a mystical experience, paddling in the fog. It felt like we were in a bubble, and it was so quiet. We came across a reef of rocks and realized we had to go around. We ran into a kelp bed and a community of rocks encrusted with barnacles. We spent some time paddling around them, snapping pictures of rocks, barnacles and each other.  </p>

<p>Seeing a lot of driftwood on the shore, James and I debated what it was all about. James thought they were man made structures and I disagreed. We paddled there to see who was right, and it turned out James was. Someone had piled driftwood into crude shelters. We landed to check things out. Chloe was excited about the structures, hopping around and energetically sniffing in and around them. We walked down the beach, noticing deer, wolf and even Chihuahua tracks in the sand! We commented that Chloe has gotten a lot stronger and healthier since she started kayaking (even though she doesn’t paddle) and is in much better spirits these days. She gets more exercise, and a lot more varied and interesting things to sniff. We determined that we definitely have to camp here some day. </p>

<p>James mentioned that we should have brought a snack and should always bring a snack. We thought we were only going to go to the estuary, but it didn’t turn out that way. We admitted we always end up going a lot further than we expect. It was resolved from that day forward that we will always bring a snack when we kayak, no matter where we think we are going. It’s a big deal, because it is very hard to paddle hungry.<br>
On the return trip, we found that the ebbing tide had changed the scenery. There were more rocks than before. The rocky reefs were bigger too, forcing us take longer detours into the centre of the bay. We met two other kayakers on the water—which is a first for us. You would think there would be more kayaking traffic on the North Island in general, but there isn’t. We exchanged our delight in seeing other kayakers. We asked them if they could suggest some good kayaking spots.  Many that they had suggested we had already been to. They also suggested that the south end of Nimpkish Lake and Huson Caves were a must. We eventually did go to Huson Caves in 2016, and the verdict is a definite “yes.” At Nimpkish Lake, however, though the scenery was stunningly beautiful and I was able to take some great photographs, it is not a good place for kayaking. It is a very long lake, making it a wind tunnel with plenty of rough water. Nimpkish Lake is more of hangout for windsurfers and parasailers. It is also good place to camp on the beach. 
Our campsite appeared out of the fog sooner than expected. The fog and the calm water made us lose our sense of time. The shoreline was much longer than it was when we left it, which probably also helped to shorten the trip. We were having a struggle carrying our kayaks up the now significantly larger shore. We thought to alternate carrying them, but, in the end we gave up and decided to leave them where they were, halfway up the shore, as the tide would probably not reach them before the next time we went kayaking. </p>

<p>We had a much needed quick lunch of smokies because we were <i>really</i> hungry! After lunch, James took the girls kayaking while I stayed behind with Chloe and wrote my reflections on my laptop until I got sleepy and had to have a nap. They were not gone too long. When the bunch came back, James told me of some of the unusual ideas they had. Tyra said she wanted to jump in the water and swim! She also kept bugging him about the lighthouse, which he considered out of the question. Then they said they were getting too hot and wanted to come in. I don’t think our 10 or 12 kilometre treks would be these girls’ cup of tea!  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post8-cluxewe/reflections.jpg" alt="Cluxewe"><em>Writing my reflections with Chloe.</em></p>

<p>James and I went out on the kayaks again at around 6 pm, when the estuary was at high tide. The fog had cleared and the water was fairly calm, with a few breakers at the shore. Even though we were only planning to do the estuary, we still packed a lunch as per our previous pact. Just as we got to the beach, James got a funny look in his eye. He looked around at the water, turned to me and said, “How ‘bout we try it?” At first, I didn’t understand what he was talking about. “Try what?” I asked. He didn’t answer me right away, as if he was expecting me to read his mind. It turned out he was meaning paddling to the lighthouse! I was taken aback, as he had been telling me and the girls all weekend that the lighthouse was off limits. I realized that it would be somewhat of a trepidatious paddle, but said a hesitant “OK.” I am a sucker for lighthouses! It would turn out to be a lot more than we bargained for! </p>

<p>We had a clumsy launch. I tried to go out onto the water on my own and ended up getting splashed. I had taken out the rim around my cockpit when I set myself inside and, in the hesitation, got my splashes. I jumped out and James fixed my cockpit.  He told me to jump in quickly, and then he gave me a push out onto the water. We met with huge swells that lifted us way up and brought us way down at regular intervals. It felt a little like being on a ferris wheel. James seemed to be keeping his cool, but I was freakin’. It was especially scary on the Eskia, because it was a much lighter craft. We paddled steady, carefully— no speeding or sudden moves. It was not just water, it was ocean, very deep and full of powerful currents in this narrow passage called the Broughton Strait, and I was one tip away from being in it! Getting capsized in this water would be very dangerous indeed—there is no telling where the currents would take us! I set aside my apprehension and just kept my mind on getting to the lighthouse. We were going at a moderate speed and only took a half an hour to get across, but it seemed like it took much much longer! When we got close to the lighthouse, we were salivating for that solid shoreline! </p>

<p>Grabbing James’ camera right away, I snapped shots of the lighthouse and the view around. In the back of my mind I was still thinking about the journey back and if I had the stomach for it, but I was savouring my time there. I got James to take several pictures of me with the lighthouse in the background. As he was taking one, he accidentally snapped a selfie and Chloe just happened to join in!  The pictures of me didn’t turn out so well, but that selfie turned out to be a gem! No one came to greet us from the buildings, but we couldn’t be too sure there was no one there. We just stayed on the shoreline, presuming it would be trespassing if we went up to the buildings. Shorelines are public domain. </p>

<p>As we had lunch, I noticed waves curling around a point. We later took a video of it, and a few photos of a big stump. Looking to the mountain range to the west, we saw a mountain top that had a shape of an indigenous chief laying on his back. It reminded me of a peak at Ironstone Lookout that the residents of Crowsnest Pass coined “Mt. Mulrooney” that looks very much like an exaggerated profile of our 18th prime minister. I also thought of the ape face at Raspberry Ridge, in Kananaskis Country by Turner Valley. When the sun is at a certain position in the sky on a sunny mid-summer day, it casts shadows on the Continental Divide producing the face of a giant ape. </p>

<p>For the trip back to the campsite, we switched kayaks. James gave me a lecture about points, that we should avoid them because they have dangerous currents. A fishing boat was passing by and James told me we had to stay back and let it pass. After it passed, he instructed me to steer straight into the waves, in case they might end up being rollers. They ended up being not that bad. I was feeling better in the Manitou because it was much more stable in the water. Chloe poked her nose out the cockpit in the beginning and sniffed, then hid herself in the cuddy for the rest of the voyage. I instinctively tried to make a B-line for the campsite, but it turned out to be the wrong plan. James actually started complaining vociferously—which is unusual for him. Because of the wind and the tide still coming in, he told me to point myself toward the estuary, which was north, even though we were trying to go <i>west</i>, to the campsite. Even though we were paddling like crazy to the north, we never passed the line between the campsite and the lighthouse! We just gradually drifted sideways, getting closer and closer to the campsite! It was an odd experience to say the least. Under these conditions, if I had been leading the way, we would have ended up further south in Port McNeill! It is amazing that tides, wind and currents can make such a difference!</p>

<p>As we got closer to shore, James devised a plan for landing. We were to head north of the campsite a bit and then drift into shore at a south-westerly angle, getting a boost from the waves. He ordered me to ride the waves and then start back paddling when I catch a surf. I’m not sure if I really understood his instructions at the time, but somehow, I seemed to have instinctively done the right thing. Mind you, I spent some time in Hawaii riding surfs, so maybe that experience came in handy. I jumped out quickly and hardly got splashed at all. </p>

<p>We were greeted by some onlookers who had watched our landing and were intrigued by our kayaking Chihuahua—especially 3 little boys in shark helmets. When I took Chloe out of the kayak, she seemed to be stuck in my arms, not wanting to be let down. I had to carry the kayak while holding her. I put Chloe on a log to socialize with the boys, while James and I answered grown ups questions about what it was like to kayak with a Chihuahua. When Chloe was done with the PR, she faced both James and me, then looked to me to pick her up. James commented, “You want mommy.” I guess when one has been through a harrowing experience, it’s mommy that they need! Once we were done tying up the kayaks, James emphatically told me he was done kayaking for the day. Later he confessed to me that that trip gave him cause to pause, which says a lot! He doesn’t get scared easily, let alone admit it! We considered kayaking the estuary later that evening, but we were unable to get up the gumption. </p>

<p>That night, after I drove to Port McNeill to get (compulsively) needed ingredients and a few treats like chips and pop, we grilled vegetables on our propane grill. James had the left over steak. To the girls, who seemed to not need food, I gave some cheese and crackers and cucumbers that they barely picked at. They had been playing poker most of the day and wanted us to join them. After we had supper, made coffee and cleaned up, we played poker by the music from the girls’ cell phones until we started yawning. The winner of the all in hand was Tyra’s friend, even though Tyra and James tended to be the winners most of the time. Late at night, we marvelled at the brightness of the stars and how many would could see. We could easily discern the band of the Milky Way. </p>

<p><b>July 9, 2015</b></p>

<p>James and I planned to get up for 8 am to take the high tide into the estuary. We woke up at 7 am, discussing it and checking the tide guide, but fell back into our beds and slept some more. At about 8, I again asked James if he wanted to get up to do the estuary, but he brushed me off saying he wanted to sleep. Later he was angry at himself for not getting up. James ended up getting up around 10:30 and I, 11:30. As we had our breakfast and packed up the vehicles, he kept beating himself up for not getting up in time to paddle the estuary. </p>

<p>You win some. You lose some. </p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><b>June 27, 2015</b></p>

<p>We agreed to get up at 7 am so we could get to Rupert Arm and Varney Bay at around 11 am for the high tide.  We wanted to take advantage of the tide, to let it carry us easily toward Varney Bay.  I slept at my place to give the cats some company before our long time away, and James stayed at his.  Leah, our regular cat sitter, was away, so I had to ask my neighbour, Cathy Anderson, to cat sit for me.  I didn’t want to ask Cathy to cat sit for me unless I absolutely needed it, as she won’t accept payment.  Cathy does a lot of volunteer work in Port Alice.  She has done so much volunteer work over the years that she can’t even remember it all; but, presently, she volunteers at the Port Alice Recycle Centre, The Legion, the Thrift Shop and at the school.  She will even help out whenever someone has a personal or health crisis!  In fact, she has even won the Governor General’s Award for volunteerism in 1988!   I call her the “Guardian Angel of Port Alice,” as she plays a major role in keeping the community going.  As payment for her good deeds, every summer I give her some elephant garlic from my garden.  She loves to get her garlic!  When I give it to her, she has such a beaming look on her face, you’d think I was giving her a bag full of money!  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post6-varney/cathy.jpg" alt="Cathy"><em>Cathy Anderson.</em></p>

<p>After I had my bath, I called James.  He was already up for a while packing up the truck.  He had put both kayaks on the truck, the Manitou in the back and the Eskia on the roof.  When I saw it, I thought my truck looked like a Christmas tree!  We were leaving the Camry behind this time.  James had charted out our route very carefully in the hope that we wouldn’t get lost.  He even suggested we stop at the side of the road once to check the map and, lo and behold, all cross roads were properly taken!  </p>

<p>To get to Varney Bay, turn left from Highway 19 at the Port Alice turnoff to Highway 30, “The Port Alice Road.”  Follow it for 10.6 kilometres, until you reach a gravel road crossing the pavement, and take a right onto Hardy Main.  Follow the gravel road for 4.5 kilometres until you reach a “Y” in the road.  Be careful to stay on the main road, until the “Y.”  There is at least a half dozen possible wrong turns you could take that could lead you to nowhere, or worse than nowhere!  When you see a sign saying “Varney Main,” take a left.  After travelling 1.5 kilometres, take Varney Main West and continue on Varney Main West for 5 kilometres.  To get to the log dump campsite, take a right.</p>

<p>At the present time (fall 2016), the log dump is deactivated as a campsite, and we’re not sure why.  It might be because the site is considered unsanitary because of a lack of outhouses.  While that campsite is closed, the only way to get to Varney Bay is to paddle there from Coal Harbour, on the east side of Holberg Inlet.  If you take that route, just make sure you don’t accidentally turn into the Quatsino Narrows thinking it is Varney Bay, or you could be in a real pickle!  You can also paddle there from the campsite at the south end of Rupert Arm, but it will be a very long paddle.  I just hope the powers that be will see the light and find some way to reopen that campsite lickety split!  Among paddling sites on the North Island, Varney Bay is a real gem.  </p>

<p>We knew we were driving into the log dump at Rupert Arm—our launch point for Varney Bay—when we saw logs.  To our surprise, however, we also saw a bunch of trailers and fifth wheels and a pack of friendly pouches.  We talked to a couple of the campers standing on a giant protruding driftwood log jutting out high above the water in front of a boat.  They told us that they were trying to make a makeshift dock with some wood they brought, but the plan was thwarted by the arrival of the log boom.  They said they were trying to get on their boat using the protruding driftwood and a ladder.  I couldn’t envision what they were trying to do, as it was looking rather impossible and pretty dangerous.  Perhaps it was a good thing the log boom was there, or they might have ended up needing an ambulance.  </p>

<p>We first intended to get on the kayaks right away.  Since this seemed to be a busy place, we decided to put up our tent to mark our spot in case someone else came.  We then hopped in the kayaks and were off with a favourable tide and wind.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post6-varney/chloegettingherlifejacketon.jpg" alt="Chloe getting her jacket on"><em>Chloe getting her jacket on.</em></p>

<p>With the tide and the wind going the same direction we were, it was a deceptively easy trip!  Coming back turned out to be a different thing altogether!  We paddled past the log boom and into the big water between Rupert Arm and Holberg Inlet.  James pointed out an island to me that was supposed to be in front of the Quatsino Narrows and talked again about riding the waves through the Narrows someday.  </p>

<p>At first we couldn’t find Varney Bay, as the entrance was camouflaged by the surrounding scenery.  We kept paddling and eventually the huge bay made its appearance.  We were getting hot under the cloudless sky.  Skirting around an island, we found a spot to land so we could cool Chloe down and have a bathroom break.  The water where we docked was shallow for a good distance into the bay.  After having a drink from our supply of liquids, we waded into the water to cool ourselves to just above our ankles.  We then carried Chloe out into the shallow water for a few metres and let her swim back to shore on her own.  I was surprised how such a round dog with skinny little legs could swim so well!   </p>

<p>Like many places around here, Varney Bay is named after a North Island pioneer.  Lord Henry Varney left England and arrived in the Quatsino settlement on the steam ship, Mischief, in 1896, with his engraved calling card that identified him as the ‘the Queen’s Messenger’…which is a little curious.  As I read through the <i>Quatisino Chronicle</i>, my main source of historical information on this area to date, I saw no record of him delivering any messages directly from the Queen.  Perhaps he saw himself as a vehicle of Commonwealth indoctrination.  He and his wife, Ethel, took up a 137 acre homestead at the mouth of the Marble River (probably not far from the very spot we were cooling ourselves down) and raised their nine children.  There was a boarded up fairly modern house on the shores of Varney Bay, just a little south of us—a sign of a good location for a homestead.  Lord Varney home schooled his children with the Bible and harsh lessons in frugality.  When he would send a couple of his children out to hunt—by themselves out amongst the bears and the cougars—he would only allow them a couple of shells and they had to come home with dinner.  He sounds like quite a character, our <i>Lord of this Neck of the Woods!</i></p>

<p>Back in the kayaks, we were having some doubts about finding this Marble River estuary.  We were told there were rock faces and caves, but, at that point, nothing of a sort seemed to be anywhere near.  The surrounding scenery seemed to be a bit too close to the ground to be hiding a canyon.  We soldiered on.  We noticed a patch of green on the water and were wondering what it was all about.  We noticed a current off to the side of the algae and followed it.  Until the bay, the tide was carrying us along.  As soon as we turned into Varney Bay, the tide was against us, as it, as well as all the other water around, was then flowing toward the Narrows.  Adding to that, we had to paddle against the outflow of the Marble River.  The arduousness of the paddle slowed down time for us.  The water was very shallow in places, and we had to navigate around big rocks.  James ended up crashing into one, giving out a yelp!  Luckily, there was no hole in the kayak!  </p>

<p>Going around a bend in the river brought us into the shadowy world we were looking for.  Rock facades appeared out of the vegetation.  The river became mysteriously cool, dark and calm.  A few wedges of bright sunlight illuminated small sections of the shadowy estuary.  Where the light touched the water, it cast rippling reflections onto the rock walls.  The odd tree reached down and out, trying to catch the limited bits of sun.  For lack of flat ground, the ferns grew sideways on the cliffs.  Dripping water made tinkly sounds as it hit the water, then echoed.  Here and there, huge spaces were gouged out of the rocks just above the water surface—the handiwork of some intense spring runoff.  The musty smell of the forest was intensified by the enclosure.  Chloe’s eyed were deliriously wide as her nose stretched far out of her cockpit.  It turned out we weren’t alone.  We heard a big splash!  We discovered we were sharing this hideaway with a seal who seemed to get a kick out of scaring us.  </p>

<p>We came upon some rapids, but passable ones.  Without hesitation or even asking if I was willing, James just trudged on through, making it look easy.  When it was my turn, I discovered it was not so easy.  I had lifted my rudder and tried to go through, but was pushed back down sideways.   I ended up having to back up.  I put my rudder down and made another run for it, paddling harder than ever.  It felt like I was climbing a mountain!  James sat safely on the other side, watching and grinning.   I think he was thinking I wasn’t going to make it through, but I did!  When I made it to calm water he cheered and said, “Aren’t proud of yourself for having done that?”  I didn’t see it as that much of an accomplishment, just something that had to be done.  Besides I was a farm girl: I was used to dealing with difficult physical limitations without all the fanfare. </p>

<p>We went around a couple of bends and then came to a sharp turn in the river with rapids, a cave, and a swirling current.  We weren’t going to be able to get past the rapids, so we decided to make a stop.  The shore was steep.  It was a complicated maneuver to land.  James got off first with ease, but I was still pretty iffy getting out of the boat (you can take the girl out of the prairie, but not the prairie out of the girl).  He held the boat and I grabbed a rock and pulled myself out like a sack of potatoes.  We tied the kayaks very securely to a small tree on the rocks.  If we lost the kayaks, it would be difficult and dangerous to retrieve them in this environment.  James kept thinking we should portage and go up further, but we ended up just staying there for no particular reason.  Later, when he googled it at home, he figured out Bear Falls might have been not far from there.  We walked around on the water-rounded rocks under a sun shining down hot and hard.  We were in our own little private oasis, notwithstanding the odd cougar or bear hanging out behind the bushes (occasionally, I honked my bicycle bear horn for security).  Not expecting to run into anyone else, we had our picnic and did some sun-bathing—swim suits optional.  James, Mr. Fast Twitch Muscle Stunt-man Sprinter Guy and Glutton for Punishment, of course, had to jump in the water for some hooting and hollering.  He tried to swim to the next bend, but couldn’t see much.  When he swam back he kept challenging me to get in the water.  I opted instead to sit in the water and watch the water flow by.  We spent a leisurely afternoon in our oasis, until the shadows moved over our picnic spot and it was time to head back. </p>

<p>The trip down river seemed so much shorter than the trip up.  Since we didn’t have to fight the current and the tide, we spent much more time looking around.  When we got back to the estuary, the water was much lower and we had to navigate carefully around the rocks.  Where before there was smooth water, we found rapids—but they were easy to handle because we were travelling with the flow of the river.  At the mouth of the estuary, we took a left turn and checked out a little cove, switching boats because the seat of the Eskia was digging into my back.  It was hot so we opted to take the shadow route back on the west side of Varney Bay, especially for Chloe’s sake.  </p>

<p>On our way back to Rupert Inlet, we were fighting the tide and the wind.  Our seemingly minutes long journey going down this route turned into a trip that took possibly hours!  After we battled to pass one point of land, we discovered another and then another, all of which seemed to take forever to get to!  I had no idea there were so many points between the camp and the estuary!  Finally, we had to take a break and get our land legs back, landing on a shadowy shore full of barnacles.  It was cold and clammy, and Chloe had a hard time walking on the barnacles.  We didn’t stay there more than a few minutes, but I needed to feel ground under my feet to be able to paddle the rest of the way. 
Getting back to camp, James got out of his kayak, dragged mine up the shore and then helped me out.  I walked slowly to the tent, and, in spite of the intense heat inside it, collapsed on the air mattress and immediately fell asleep.  James came sometime later and became comatose too.  </p>

<p>Coming out of my nap, I heard to the grunting and groaning of a tugboat taking logs away.  I got up to take pictures.  By the evening, the log 
boom was gone. We started a fire, visited a bit with our human and doggie neighbours and took numerous pictures of the sunset over Rupert Inlet. </p>

<p><b>June 28, 2015</b>,</p>

<p>After the magnificent trip down the estuary, we were expecting a low-key day.  It didn’t turn out that way.  Somehow, James, Chloe and I seem to have a real knack for finding adventure.  We first contemplated just lazing around all morning.  With the water very still and the coming of slack tide around noon, we got lured into cutting across the Rupert Arm Inlet to visit the old Utah Mine site.  We talked about my need for a hat and sunglasses.  I tried to put a pair of James’s sunglasses over mine, but it didn’t work.  I took my glasses off and put on the sunglasses alone.  I was surprised that there didn’t seem to be much difference in my vision. As near sighted people get older, their vision improves.  I put my prescription glasses in the dry bag and just used the sunglasses.  It wasn’t a fashion statement, but it worked.  I opted to go without a hat, as none of James’ hats fit my head (hats rarely do) and I have plenty of hair for protection anyway.<br>
While we were getting ready, Chloe waited dutifully by the kayaks across the roadway.  She now gets eager to go on a kayak ride like she does a car ride!  Even though she seemed to look forward to the ride, she did nothing but whine all the way across.  We eventually figured out she was probably too hot, and that we would have to keep wetting her down.  We arrived at the north end of the mine and paddled in, out and around the maze of logs and machinery, feeling like kids in an adult sized playground.  </p>

<p>Paddling south of the mine, we came upon the artificial cove created to fill the old copper mine site when it was closed nearly 20 years ago.  James, the Campbell River native, said it took a long time to fill up.  My research tells me it took from May 15th to August 15th in 1996 to be exact.  When the mine site was finally filled, it was sealed off from the cove.  It was then left to nature—in a very big way as we would soon find out!  As we paddled deeper into the man-made cove, we were both looking at a spot with a cliff and tall dark and spooky looking pine trees.  A gigantic eagle soared from tree to tree, looking not the least bit intimidated by our presence.   We were actually intimidated by his, because of Chloe.  An eagle could easily pick up a dog like Chloe.  When I first went to a mountain lookout, I had my then 10-year old son with me and I was told, to my amazement, an eagle would be able to pick him up!  It seems hard to believe, was probably unlikely (especially since I always kept him close by) but was very possible!  James and I have seen footage on TV of an eagle flying while dangling a mountain goat from its claws!    </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post6-varney/theeagle.jpg" alt="The eagle"><em>The eagle.</em></p>

<p>We came up to a spot near the end of the cove with a flat sandy beach under some old twisted pines.  As we approached we peered into a small clearing in the bushes and thought we saw a deer.  It was certainly the size of a deer.  It seemed to move like a deer.  It was definitely the colour of a deer.  I shouted to James to look.  He also thought it was a deer.  Then, the creature turned in a way that was very <i>undeerlike</i>.  Even without my glasses I could see that it was definitely not a deer, as its tail was way too long and bushy!  I yelled “It’s a wolf!”  The wolf gave us perturbed look, then walked off on his incredibly long legs.  </p>

<p>After the caves at the Marble River Estuary, we weren’t expecting much excitement.  We got some anyway.</p>

<p>Sometime after this kayaking trip, I took the ferry to Vancouver.  To entertain the passengers, there was a biologist on board giving a talk about sea otters.  To get the talk going, she asked members of the audience if they had had any wildlife sightings.  People mentioned seeing bears, whales, sea lions, sea otters, eagles, and so on.  I then piped up with “wolf.”  The biologist looked at me, surprised, and then said, “I’m jealous.”  You know you’ve had a rare animal sighting when you can make a biologist envious! </p>

<p>Finding a place to land a good distance from the spot where we saw the wolf, we had a snack on shore and marvelled at what we had just experienced.  James and I then switched kayaks for the trek back across Rupert Arm.  We paddled alongside the shore to a far point and then decided to make the mad dash across the inlet.  James had the more stable kayak and didn’t even use a rudder.  I had the more slippery one.  We debated about which point to head into the crossing.  I wanted to go further south and then let the wind, waves and tide carry us down the shore to the campsite.  James wanted to cut diagonally across.  I tried to do what he wanted but found my kayak not cooperating with my intentions.  My rudder was pushed all the way down, but somehow, I was only managing to go straight across the inlet instead of diagonally.  It may have been that way because I was getting knocked around going parallel with the waves.  Turning perpendicular into the waves gave me some stability.  “Boy are you stubborn!” James said as he followed me straight across.  Yes, I’m stubborn, I proudly admit it, but I only draw on that stubbornness when absolutely necessary or for something very important.  I wasn’t trying to be stubborn this time.  I was also getting frustrated with the roughness of the waves and wanted the uneasy crossing to be over as soon as possible, so I did some sprinting.  I was surprised how paddling a certain way and expending a lot of effort turned my kayak into a speed machine. It was easier to do on the Eskia too, because it was the lighter swifter boat.  </p>

<p>We had a complicated difficult docking at low tide.  James landed first and took out Chloe and all his stuff, then lifted his kayak by himself out of the water.  I paddled around to keep from being swept north by the wind and the waves until it was my turn to dock.  James held down my kayak so I could lift myself out with relative ease.  For nearly 40 years of my life, I have virtually survived by my own means and in some pretty rough conditions!  Now, I have a partner who worries about me getting in and out of a kayak!  Like I said before, I will enjoy this situation before he sees the light!  </p>

<p>We dragged the kayaks onto the grass, sat down and drank some fake beer and then; after creating as much air circulation as possible inside the tent by opening windows, we did some reading on our air mattresses and had a nap.  </p>

<p>For the rest of the night we sat around our fire, eating smokies, watching the flames and admiring the sunset at its various stages. James was doing some sorting with our camping gear, so I decided to go to the docking area.  I sat on the rocks, meditating and watching the sunset, thinking back to my days at Round Hill Tower in Lac La Biche in the 1980s when I would, after a day in the fire tower, sometimes go down to the lake at Mile 27 in my little Honda Civic (you’d be amazed how that little city car managed in the bush!) and do this very thing.  I tried to capture that feeling again, of being alone in my own little bubble—which is quite different from my life now.  James can’t seem to figure out why I don’t seem to get “lonely” when he goes a way to work for a couple of weeks or month.  I frequently have to remind him that it has been like I’ve been on the TV series <i>Alone</i> for 4 to 6 months at a time for 18 years of my life!  </p>

<p>I sometimes miss being alone.  I miss being able to hear my own thoughts.  I can get tired of the endless distractions of civilized life: the scheduling, the commuting, the multi tasking and the playing phone tag.  Curious things can happen in solitude.  Once you get adjusted to the idea of being alone, you start to notice more things around you.  You notice the wildflower you might not have seen if you were conversing with someone.  You notice all the markings of a caterpillar and its unique way of moving.  You start to see all the diversity in nature: that it’s not just trees and grass, but a huge plethora of vegetation competing and cooperating for the same space.  Not only that, but you may discover, like I did, that plants can “talk.”  Very often I will go out to my garden and sit on my lawn chair with no preconceived plan or intention.  As I sit there, “taking it all in,” I notice thoughts that creep into my brain that seem to be the quiet voices of the plants trying to communicate their needs to me.  They will say things to me like, “Hey lady, we need pruning, or hilling, or watering right now.”  Although one can say it is all still my own thoughts, sometimes I can come up with ideas that I never thought of before, or ideas I haven’t thought about in a while, even decades. You might say that is just creativity, but what, really, is creativity?  It might be just a nebulous name for some entity we can’t understand yet. I think the First Nations people have come closer to giving that entity a more distinct form in the shape of “spirits” of animals, the land, the sky and the water.  </p>

<p>In solitude, you discover that the animals have temperaments, and that you can mentally connect with them, even share a bit of good humour.  Although you don’t share a language, you can get a lot of information from their body language, their gestures and the look in their eyes.  When you can connect with another creature in this way, it can sometimes make you feel that language is redundant. </p>

<p>In solitude, you realize clouds are not just clouds, and that there is a complex interplay going in the skies too. You become more aware of the moon, the stars and the planets.  You can look out in the southwest sky and see Mars hanging there, looking so clear and orange and immediate, that it feels like you’re peeking into your next-door neighbour’s yard!  Not only that, but removing people and distraction allows more things to come up from within.  The vacuum of solitude leaves more room for ideas to come up from the imagination, which is how I got into writing in the first place.  </p>

<p>Lately, I’ve developed a special “thinking technique.”  I just ask my brain for an idea or a solution to a problem, release it, and, sometime later, usually when I’m quiet and away from distractions, the answer comes to me as if delivered by another force.  I’ve come to recognise a force in my brain that is possibly <i>not</i> my brain.  A while back, I disconnected my cable TV and discovered, to my surprise, I was not bored at all!  On the contrary, I found myself bombarded with ideas and solutions to problems like crazy!  For those of you suffering from writer’s block, just get away from the crowds, shut off all the media, be still, and your writer’s block will probably be dislodged!  The cable TV is connected again; but, I limit how much I watch it.  After my experience without TV, I notice now, that when I watch it, I feel a little like a zombie, or like I’m being hypnotized, and I find it a little disturbing.  </p>

<p>Living in solitude also leaves room for things to come up from the subconscious mind—some of it scary, some of it delightful.  You have the time to think about certain assumptions that were false and misleading, and analyze your own responses to others and others’ responses to you.  You get less reactionary and more contemplative (simply because there is no one around to react to!).  I found I became more aware of my dreams, and at times felt I was getting special messages delivered to me through my dreams—something I might not have noticed while maintaining a “busy” life.  </p>

<p>I’ve come to understand the forest as not just a bunch of trees, animals and vegetation, but as a spiritual entity.  Even though there may be bears and cougars around that could eat me, there is something about that spiritual entity that is deeply comforting!  When I’m alone, I don’t really feel alone at all; in fact, quite the contrary.  I become friends with my surroundings, as well as my inner life, my psychic reality and possibly alternate creative realities.  I tend to feel alone in places like downtown Vancouver with its many attention grabbers that take me away from my inner self.  It’s a good thing I’m living in Port Alice—the next best thing to living in a lookout—and that I have a partner who likes sitting in the bush and watching time go by as much as I do.  If I was forced to live in the city again year round, I would probably loose all my marbles!  I would have to press the rescue button on the proverbial satellite phone and beg to be dropped somewhere in the middle of nowhere!  </p>

<p>In some indigenous cultures, young people have to perform a rite of passage by travelling into the forest or the dessert all alone with only a few tools.  It seems like a cruel thing to do; however, if you survive the trip, it can give you an inner strength and awareness that is invaluable!  Perhaps experiences of solitude are relevant for all cultures, and could have an effect of curbing crime, depression and relationship dysfunction.  </p>

<p>James came up to me a little cautiously.  He asked me for permission to join me and permission was granted.  We threw stones in the water.  As our ripples merged, it created a glittery effect on the water that seemed to go on and on—long after the ripples were done being ripples. We sat quietly, enjoying the light and colour, until Venus dropped down from a sheet of middle cloud, then Jupiter.  </p>

<p><b>June 29, 2015</b></p>

<p>Our neighbours moved out, leaving their smouldering fire as if they thought it would somehow put itself out!  I was shocked, especially when a forest officer drove into the campsite a couple of days before to remind us to put out our campfires and that a fire ban was imminent!  As the campfire culprit drove away, he stopped and generously handed us some of his catch of prawns and crab.  Thanks for the fish, but not for nearly burning down our forests!   With slightly stunned looks, we graciously accepted the offering.  We decided to shift camp and use his fire for our crab and prawn feast.  We put Chloe on a folding camp chair with an umbrella to block out the sun.  James made a bit of garlic butter for the prawns and fried them up.  We boiled up the crab and sat breaking them and munching on them for quite some time.  It wasn’t just <i>eating</i>, it was <i>playing</i> too.  James said you could tell the meat was fresh because it was plump—no shrinkage.  We doused the fire completely and took a picture of it for old time’s sake.  We partially loaded up the truck, but left the tent up because our comforter was drying on top of it.  </p>

<p>Before going back home, we opted for a “short quick trip” across the inlet, which turned out to be a lot more than that.  Because of the heat, we rigged up an umbrella on the boat so Chloe could have some shade.  It produced a lot of laughs.  We headed for what we thought was an island.  We paddled straight and steady.  After reaching the other side, we saw a couple of quiet coves with clear greenish water.  Just when we were about to land, the water started churning up.  I got panicky and insisted we go straight back.  James said, “Hold on a minute here, I’m not going anywhere without my snack!” so we docked at the cove.  James gets lots of “snack attacks”; in fact, he is a virtually non-stop eating machine!  It’s a mystery why he stays so slim!  I am beginning to think that peoples’ metabolisms are as unique and varied as their personalities.    </p>

<p>We found a nice log to sit on in front of a massive tree stump.  We watched the waves churn about as we ate!  We were especially vigilant about keeping Chloe on the leash, after seeing Mr. Wolf and Mr. Eagle yesterday.  I took pictures of a giant stump and the sea asparagus on the shore.  If you’re ever a contestant on the TV series <i>Alone</i>, you can get your vitamins from sea asparagus.  They are OK to eat raw.  They are salty and a bit crunchy, reminding me of potato chips.  You can also use them to make stir fries, and even pickles.  I made a batch of sea asparagus pickles and found them to be quite tasty, though James hasn’t been willing to brave them so far.  Oh well, all the more for me!  The interesting thing about making stuff from foraged food is that it is hard to eat in the beginning, simply because it is so unfamiliar.  Once you make the paradigm shift, you can never go back!  Something similar bought in the store just doesn’t have the character and richness as something made with foraged or home grown food.  For recipes for sea asparagus pickles and stir fries, check out Google.  I found a good pickle recipe at <i>www.westcoastseaweed.com.</i></p>

<p>Between watching <i>Alone</i>, and doing my own research, I am amazed at the amount of available food there is in nature.  I’ve even seen hungry <i>Alone</i> contestants walk past stuff they could have made a hardy meal out of!  You need to know what you’re are doing though, as, in my estimation, about half the stuff that is out in nature is poisonous.  It is amazing that animals know what’s safe and what’s not without access to the internet!  They have <i>another</i> internet that they use.  Maybe some day we humans might have full access to <i>that</i> internet…and then maybe we can clean up the mess we are making of our planet!   </p>

<p>When we were done eating, all our cameras out of power, we put them in the dry bag.  We realized that Chloe’s umbrella was going to have to be packed up because it would be a hindrance going back through the rough water.  Luckily the waves were perpendicular to our direction, so we could cut straight through them to prevent tipping.  We were definitely dealing with the “time moving more slowly” effect.  We bounced a lot and got splashed a few times.  Maintaining a faster steady pace on the rough water was wearing me out.  At the end, James got a second wind and sprinted.  I had no hopes of beating him, but I was determined to keep up with him.  When he turned back to look, he was surprised to find me not far behind.  I said I knew he’d be surprised.  </p>

<p>After we landed I found a blanket and lay there immobile for quite some time.  James came over and gave me a sympathy cuddle and continued to pack up the truck.  I joked that he can load up the truck and I’ll supervise and make sure he’s doing a good job. </p>

	     <p><b>June 21, 2015</b></p>

<p>We were discussing the various possibilities for kayaking, and wanted to leave some of the best stuff for a visit from James’s daughter and/or my son. On this day we settled on few hours of kayaking on Neroutsos Inlet, which included the Frigon Islands and the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Some of you might be wondering about the names of our inlet and the islands in them. Yes, “Neroutsos” does sound a lot like the psychological disorder and Frigon sounds like a substitute swear word. Back in the seventies, when the mill dumped pollution into the inlet indiscriminately (before they seriously cleaned up their act because of new government regulations), people who were opposed to it would call it, “Neurosis Inlet.” Well, the name “neurosis” seems to have stuck. When I came here in 2010, practically anyone I’ve talked to has pronounced the name like the psychological disorder. If you look closely at the name “Neroutsos” and follow the rules of English pronunciation, it should sound a little different. It doesn’t flow smoothly off the tongue, however, which is probably why people tend to default to “neurosis.”</p>

<p>The name “Neroutsos” actually has a very honourable origin. It was the name of a hardy and heroic big wig and pioneer in the development of navigation in western coastal waters, Captain Cyril Demitrius Neroutsos. Born into a wealthy shipping family in 1868 in Bowden, Cheshire, England, his considerable metal was soon tested when he became an orphan at age 13. With barely any time to grieve his circumstances, he set out on the high seas as an officer cadet. In addition to trade excursions around the globe, he ended up participating in the New Zealand to London clipper ship races around the Cape. By the time he reached 18, he had sailed around the world four times! With the arrival of steam, Neroutsos acquired his papers for deep sea master and signed on with the <i>British India Steam Navigation Company</i>. This brought him to Seattle during the Klondike Gold Rush where he became marine superintendent for the <i>Frank Waterhouse Company</i>. In 1901, he switched over to the <i>Canadian Pacific Navigation Company</i>; and, because of his qualification as a lieutenant Commander in the <i>Royal Naval Reserve</i>, he was promoted from marine superintendent to Manager of the costal fleet.  Although his knowledge of the deep seas was impeccable, he signed on as a mate on the <i> S.S. Islander</i> in order to gain more familiarity with coastal waters. While he was asleep in his quarters, the ship struck an iceberg off the shores of Alaska and sank in 20 minutes. As soon as the ship struck, Neroutsos went knocking on cabin doors, waking up passengers and assisting people onto the deck. The last man off the deck before the ship disappeared into the sea, he continued his heroic feats in the water. A strong swimmer and apparently impervious to the frigid Alaska water (I can’t even handle the water down here in the middle of the summer!) he helped save a man with an injured leg by lifting him onto a door from the wreckage. Incredibly, he stayed afloat in the water until help arrived! When he was found, Neroutsos was hypothermic, but holding an unconscious girl on his shoulders who survived because of his efforts. There were many causalties from the sinking. Neroutsos was the only executive officer to survive.</p>

<p>Despite this legendary account, Neroutsos is remembered because he was able to make sweeping advancements in coastal navigation in a single lifetime, keeping people as safe as possible in the relatively uncharted waters of the New World. </p>

<p>Ed Frigon, after whom our islands are named, was another unbeatable North Island pioneer. Hailing from Maurice Quebec, he set out to make it big in the California Gold Rush of the 1850s. When things did not go his way there, he set his compass for a life of adventure in the Pacific Northwest. After working a few years in Victoria to save money, he chartered a sealing schooner for Hope Island (Bull Harbour) in 1857. He spent 32 years running a fur trading post for local First Nations and passing sealing and whaling ships. In 1895, he moved to Limestone Island, now called Drake Island, in the Quatsino area. This is the island that we saw on our paddle from Atkin’s Cove. It is interesting to think that this lonely looking uninhabited island was once a happening place! In Quiet Cove (now called Pamphlet Cove), in the middle of the Island, Frigon opened a trading post, a floating wharf and a three storey hotel with fourteen rooms and a saloon! The hotel ran for 8 years before it was shut down mainly because of prohibition in 1917. An elderly Ed Frigon then moved to a large homestead north of Port Alice to spend his remaining days with his late in life love interest First Nations woman and “Last of the Longheads,” Lucy Moon, who was about 50 years his junior. </p>

<p>Frigon was only 5’2”, but he was strong as an ox, with a personality to suit. A true pioneer, he chose to live in a remote part of the world where there were very few white people, and probably not a single Francophone! Not only did he survive life in the wilderness, he found a way to make a living. He gave commerce on the North Island a serious jump start in the process. He was so much the heartbeat of commercial life of the community that his influence continued even after he passed away. A general store in Quatsino that opened shortly after his death was named after him. Lucy Moon remained living on Frigon’s property, and, after teaming up with Nip Wong, worked Frigon’s land and supplied Port Alice with fresh produce for many years. Frigon’s hotel was floated down to the old Port Alice townsite and renamed “Jones’s Hotel” and used for housing mill workers. It was also used as a community dance hall that was probably the starting point of many Port Alice romances. The hotel was finally destroyed in the mid-1960s, along with the rest of the buildings of Old Port Alice, when the town site was moved to Rumble Beach. Probably every transaction that happens and every child that is born on the North Island since is, in some way, touched by the ghost of Ed Frigon. </p>

<p>We were getting pretty fast at loading and unloading the kayaks. We launched at low tide at the Marina, but not at the boat dock because I think you have to pay. We passed boats and a pole coated with mussels going up to the highest tide level. We were heading in the direction of the Frigon Islands. We passed around the north side, seeing the rocks encrusted with barnacles and plant life in a variety of hues. When you launch at low tide, you get to see everything that lives under the water part time! When we came around the other side, we found a small cove with a pebbly beach. We decided this was to be the place for our snack when we were ready. </p>

<p>We contemplated visiting some friends who lived across the inlet. We had started out quite late (we slept in), so we had missed the best part of the day for paddling on calm waters. We headed in that direction, but chickened out part way there. We were suspecting the waves would get choppy soon from the inflow winds. For those of you who don’t know what inflow winds are (I just learned this recently), they are produced when the mid-day heat from the inlet rises up and creates a gap for cooler winds to come rushing in from the ocean. When the winds come rushing down the inlet, not only does it create wind resistance, it makes for higher waves, and, depending what is happening with the tides and the currents, it can make for complicated boating in general. Neroutsos Inlet is a great place for low key kayaking, what I like to call “Chihuahua kayaking”— or family kayaking, as it is sheltered from the rough waters of the ocean by mountain ranges. It is not like some places around Tofino that have breakers and high waves which are good for surfing and more acrobatic kayaking. On the inlet, you only have to work around the inflow winds; but, even then, they are only a bit challenging. You will get a good example of this later in this account. Generally speaking, to get calm easy kayaking, you should do it in the morning. Unfortunately, James and I are not morning people, but we’re working on it. </p>

<p>I didn’t want to do the trip across the inlet either because we still hadn’t found a proper life jacket for Chloe. James recently went to Campbell River to get her a life jacket and take care of some other business. When he put it on Chloe, she didn’t look too comfortable. He had been looking for a life jacket for her for a while with little luck. Chloe is a small dog who is big around the middle. Most small dog vests tend to be too small and medium sized vests fit her around the middle, but nowhere else. We thought the tabs at the front of this latest one might be too bothersome for her small head. James said he saw one that would be better at Bosley’s, but they didn’t have her size. We decided to return the life jacket he bought and keep looking for a better one. This is not easy for us, as we live two and half hours from “civilization.” Shopping on the North Island hasn’t improved much since Ed Frigon’s time.  </p>

<p>As we paddled around we saw a prawning boat and waited until it passed us. We were respecting the laws of the water: little boats yield to big boats. We then had a little fun bouncing up and down on the wake waves. Later there came a tremendously large sailboat with the sails down. We estimated its value at about a million. When we launched from the marina, we saw two boats that we estimated at 200 and 300 thousand. Such capitalists we are! We appreciate a boat’s beauty by its possible price tag! You have to admit that the price tag has a definite bearing on aesthetics! It just happens to be one aspect of appreciating something than most people can relate to. I mentioned to James that I thought this inlet should be full of such boats, as well as kayaks and canoes and such. I think Port Alice is a mini Monaco that has not been discovered yet.</p>

<p>The water wasn’t very choppy, but we suspected it would be soon. By the time we headed back to the Island, it was past noon and we were hungry. As we landed, the tide was low so there was plenty of ground to walk on. We realized that high tide would leave only a narrow grassy patch between the two islands. It might even be completely submersed in a super high tide. There were remnants of a campfire right on that ridge. We contemplated how it would be fun to spend the night here, looking at the “bright lights” of Port Alice while sitting around a campfire. There is beauty to be found in human constructions, as well as Nature’s. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post5-friggon/jamesmefrigon.jpg" alt="Friggon Islands"><em>James and me on the Frigon Islands.</em></p>

<p>We sat down and had our lunch of hummus and rice crackers, cheese and blue berries. The crows on the Islands made quite a racket for quite some time, enough to start getting on our nerves. I’m not sure what the issue was, whether they felt we intruding on their territory or if they were excited about possible left overs and handouts. These crows were very different from the crows in Port Alice. The crows at the school, in particular, gather on the roof of the school at recess time, waiting in a row and quietly watching as the kids as they drop all kinds of goodies and crumbs on the ground. When the class bell rings they know it is <i>their</i> lunch time! These crows on the Frigon Islands were a little more “wild.” Their cawing was loud and hostile sounding. They did settle down eventually, though. I guess it was a different “tribe” of crows, with different customs and practices. </p>

<p>On the island, Chloe engaged herself in the doggie business of sniffing around for “doggie emails” and sending a few herself.  Animals have their own version of the internet based on scent! After our snack, James, Chloe and I went searching for trails. The North part of the island was quite forbidding: it was tightly closed in with very thick trees and Salal. We found what looked like a trail opening on the south end of the island. We pushed through the Salal to find somewhat of a clearing that would be reasonably good for pitching a tent. We followed the very overgrown but still faintly discernible trail to the south end of the island and found a lookout perch with a rough hewnbench, another remnant of a campfire and one heck of a view! We could see some island lumps sticking out of the water. The view of the inlet was a high one, and we felt like we were on top of the world! It would be wonderful to sit and stare at it in front of a campfire around twilight and then watch the stars at night without fear of running into predators. Looking up from the lookout perch, we saw a weather worn old snag with all the crows sitting on it, by this time settled down. I took some nice shots of them, but most had flown away before I was able to get a really good one. I then took some nice shots of the view. We sat for quite some time in the sun and enjoyed the view. Chloe made herself comfortable under the bench in the shade. It was hot! </p>

<p>Instead of going back into the brush, we went around the rocks down to the cove and back to our landing spot. When we got back there, we discovered that the crows had cleared away our left-over crackers!  No wonder they settled down! We went walking around the north side of the island looking for a trail in a few places but we were forced to turn back. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post5-friggon/crows.jpg" alt="Friggon Islands"><em>The crows.</em></p>

<p>There was a lot of sea asparagus on the island. James and I quibbled on how to pick them. I tried to pick them individually and he just pulled them up by the handfuls. I told him to be more selective, and just pick the nice bright green juicy looking ones. It also gives the plant a greater chance of surviving. James joked that he was fired. I said “Yeh, you are!” but he just kept on picking, though he did start to be more selective. I mentioned I could consult my Chinese cookbooks and make a stir fry with them with Chinese mushrooms, fresh mushrooms and maybe black beans. We started picking them where there was more shade, as that was where they seemed to be the greenest and juiciest. We picked a Ziploc container full and then some, which was too bad, because we ended up forgetting them and not realizing it until we got all the way back home. </p>

<p>Worried that the tide might take our boats away, James had tied them to a big piece of driftwood. When we arrived, the kayaks were sitting on rocks. By the time we were getting ready to leave, they were floating and James had to pull them in. As I was waiting for James to load up, I slowly paddled out to the mouth of the little cove and was peek-a-booed by a seal! Its head was just above the water and it was staring at me with a child-like curiosity for some moments before it ducked out of sight. I could definitely get a “vibe” from this seal. Just like I can get a good idea of what someone is thinking by their facial expression and body language, I felt a short merging of minds with this seal. It turns out, seeing us humans is as much of a novelty as seeing them is for us! </p>

<p>James was taking a while packing up and, used to him being so efficient and thorough, I didn’t worry about the sea asparagus that I left a little too far from our gear. We paddled around the south of the islands between the out-cropping of rocks, running into some kind of swimming grey fluffy water birds. Then, it was on to the lighthouse!</p>

<p>Having been a lookout, I have quite an affinity for lighthouses. I was determined to get there sometime and it looked like this was the day. We probably should have gone there first, because, by the time we were on our way there, it was well into the afternoon and the water was starting to get rough. We probably should have gone to the lighthouse first, <i>then</i> the islands. The water got rougher as we got closer to the lighthouse. I absolutely wanted a nice picture of the lighthouse, but my phone camera-- James’s old Galaxy 3--was out of battery. There was only James’ brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that he just bought a few days ago in Campbell River that still had battery life—but he had it in his boat! Because the water was so rough and the current kept pushing us all about, we were having trouble getting coordinated. We were reluctant to pass the brand new phone from one kayak to the other for fear it would end up on the bottom of the inlet!  Having a couple of art degrees, I’m pretty persnickety about how to take photos. I went to the place to show James where I wanted the picture to be taken from, but, after doing a little fiddling and looking away, the current had pushed me metres away from the desired position! I was also scared of getting too close to the lighthouse, for fear of crashing into it and losing my balance. It was a lot like being on a conveyor belt, with a large immobile jagged object at one end of it! Alas, I was unsuccessful at getting my message across. James took several photos, but they were not centred like I wanted them and probably not taken from the place that I wanted them taken. He suggested we could crop it.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/post5-friggon/frenzy_lighthouse.jpg" alt="Friggon Islands"><em>Frenzy around the lighthouse.</em></p>

<p>Between our battles with the current and the increasing choppiness of the water, we suddenly sensed an urgency to head to shore and abandon this business of getting a well-framed photograph. We were especially nervous since Chloe did not have her life jacket yet. We were bumping up and down on the waves, which was kind of fun albeit a little nerve wracking. We tried to head to shore but didn’t seem to be getting anywhere at all! We were aiming to head north to Jeune Landing and it was proving elusive as the current kept pushing us away from it. Finally, frustrated, I was determined to get out of this rough water. I said to James “race ya!” and engaged my paddling warp drive in the hopes of actually getting somewhere. It worked and the shore finally came in sight. James wasn’t too far behind me. We arrived at the shore, a bit south of Jeune Landing. The waves were still just as high as they were in the middle of the inlet and the current was still pushing us south. That short trip would have demanded a lot of power and we were just about spent! We gave up going to Jeune Landing and followed the shore back to the marina. We likely got ourselves on TV when we paddled by the Brooks Bay Cable weather camera. We complained how tired we were the whole way back, paddling slowly and meekly like we were a couple of 120-year olds (I was inclined to say 90 year olds, but I suspect that there are some 90 year olds out there who could seriously out paddle us!). Even Chloe was looking tired, though she didn’t have to paddle. She had emerged from her fleece and was sitting up, hot and panting, with her unusually big tongue hanging way out. We brought our two kayaks together and poured some water into her little red bowl so she could have a drink. </p>

<p>As is evidenced by our experience that day, boating can be pretty complicated. Between currents, tides, weather and the position of the sun, not to mention whatever may be under the water like reefs, whales and icebergs, you have to know what is going to happen in the water at any particular time and where exactly it will happen. Just think, our Captain Neroutsos had to have a good grasp of all these factors for the <i>entire west coast</i>—not to mention the fact that he knew this stuff for all the oceans around the world—and in a time before GPS and Google maps! It’s hard even to imagine! The guy definitely deserves to have an inlet named after him!  Both Neroutsos and Frigon very much deserved their honours, as they both seemed larger than life. Now, after researching these two men, when I say “Frigon Islands on Neroutsos Inlet,” I no longer say it with a bit of a snigger, but with reverence. </p>

<p>Once we were on shore, we discovered we were more tired than we originally thought. My body felt like lead. We were even too pooped to wash down the kayaks. For the rest of the day we were virtually useless, doing minimal domestic routine like zombies, afflicted with something that only a good night’s sleep could remedy. </p>

<p>I would like to say a special thanks to Evelyn Hartford at the Port Alice Tourist Information centre for providing me with historical information for this and future blog entries. A lot of the history of Port Alice cannot easily be found in mainstream information sources. Thankfully, people like her are indispensable for keeping this information preserved and bringing awareness to that fact before it is forever lost to the passage of time.</p>

<p><i>I&#39;d like to thank Gwen Hansen at the Quatsino Museum for providingme with information on Ed Frigon for this and future posts. I hopes she&#39;s right, and that someone makes a movie about &quot;Old Ned&quot; someday.</i></p>

	     <p><b>June 13, 2015</b></p>

<p>When I write, I try to allow “other forces” to intervene in my final product.  Perhaps it includes the subconscious mind, the collective unconscious, higher levels of awareness in the human brain, mind-controlling aliens or just plain old Mother Nature speaking through my laptop.  I just let my thoughts flow freely and worry about editing later.  Employing the technique of brainstorming, I can sometimes get little “treats” or little “coincidences” in my writing such as allusion, symbolism and multiple levels of meaning without any apparent deliberation on my part.  The theme of ‘secrets’ in my Link River account only became apparent to me when it was in the final proofing stage.  The ‘lost’ element in the Atkins Cove adventure naturally lead to a discussion of what to do if you are lost in the woods.  The theme that seems to have emerged with this account seems to be the physical forces of nature, and how they can bring about changes in our surroundings and in our lives.     </p>

<p>James had hankering for a camping trip, seemingly out of the blue.  I, however, had some business to take care of on Friday, so we settled for a short two day trip “in our backyard” (it’s so nice to have such beautiful things in our back yard) at Marble River by the Salmon Hatchery at the northern tip of Alice Lake.  For something that was “in our back yard,” the Marble River Campsite was not lacking in exoticness!  In addition to the typical Vancouver Island trees that seem to reach to the heavens, there was thick shrubbery dividing the sites and creating a feeling of coziness and privacy—not that there were many people around that we needed to block out!  There was the additional bonus of the soothing sounds of rushing water from the Marble River Rapids.  We settled into site eight, near an embankment above the river.  We were fenced in by tall coniferous trees that were spaced far enough apart to let in a good bit of sun in the middle of the day.  We had everything: sun, shade, openness, coziness, lots of trees and lots of space all at the same time.  Oddly, the centrepiece of this trip was the campsite, and how we treated it like it was our living room.   </p>

<p>On Saturday we launched into the river from the boat launch by the bridge.  We paddled leisurely on still water, enjoying the sun when it showed up from behind the clouds now and then, and talking about life.  It was around here that James “casually” mentioned something about moving in together.  We took our time dipping in and out of small coves and checking them out.  We found a tall rock face and took numerous pictures, most of which turned out bad or blurry.  I was pretty nervous about getting close to the rock face.  The water below looked very dark, cold and endless.  Paddling a little further we came close enough to point out the direction of the cabin we found on our trip to Link River.  When the wind started to pick up and the water got choppy, we reversed direction and headed back to the campsite.  We passed by one rocky island, getting some flak from some small gulls with black tipped wings.  After checking our bird book later, we believe they might have been California gulls.  Though we got a lot of noise from them, we didn’t get dive-bombed.  We suspected that that would have been the case had we tried to land (not there was much of a place to land on the steep rocky edge of the island). We checked what we thought at first was a cove, but it turned out to be an island.  As we paddled around it, we found some boaters relaxing on a make-shift dock.  Chloe gave them her most menacing bark and they all laughed.  When we landed back at the bridge, we contemplated leaving the kayaks there so we wouldn’t have to pack them all up just to drive a few metres to the campsite.  We decided against it and went through our complete routine of putting the kayaks on our vehicles, which was a good thing since it ended up that we didn’t go kayaking the next day.  </p>

<p>When we came back to camp we had smokies and my creation of a gluten free smore with bananas, chocolate and whipped cream.  I made one for myself first, as I had never made one before.  I sliced a banana in half, put chocolate in between and wrapped it in tin foil.  I kept it on the fire just long enough to melt the chocolate.  Once it was melted, I sprayed whipped cream on it and “voila”:  banana smore!  It worked, so James was willing to take a chance on one.  We later bemoaned the fact that we didn’t bring the Yahtzee game, but managed to keep chatting into the night.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/bananasmore.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>Mmm. Banana Smore!</em> </p>

<p>I was allowed to go on a field trip with the school that I work for as a lunch supervisor on Monday, but was debating whether or not to go.  We were feeling pretty cozy at Marble River.  James wouldn’t have been able to go on the school trip with me because he wasn’t staff or a parent of one of the kids that go there.  After checking out our map and finding a boat icon at the trail head, we decided to try to go to San Jo Bay on the San Josef River with our kayaks.  When I did some research the following Tuesday I found out that, because it is a tidal river, we would have to time our trip with the tides.  If not, we would have to portage a couple of times.  That wasn’t so bad, but when we later checked the website for BC Parks, we found out that dogs aren’t allowed at Cape Scott Provincial Park because of problems with wolves!  So much for that grand plan!  When we go there, Chloe is going to have to stay with a dog sitter.  </p>

<p><b>June 15, 2015</b></p>

<p>We decided to take a hiatus from kayaking and try out the Marble River Trail.  I have an arthritic knee and was worried I wouldn’t be able to do it. We thought about doing it on our bikes together, but we would have had a hard time bringing Chloe along.  She is not terribly good around bikes, and we couldn’t let her run loose in the park.  James came up with the idea that he walks with Chloe on a leash and I take the bike so as not to add undue pressure on my knee.  It was a nice idea... in theory.   </p>

<p>We walked to the entrance of the campsite and took the fork that went up to the old campsite that is not maintained.  As we walked by the sites, we saw picnic tables at various stages of sinking slowly to the ground and being consumed by moss and shrubbery.  At the most northerly end of the loop, we found a gap in the trees and guessed that this might be the trail head.  There were no signs, no nothing!  I come from Alberta where signage is quite user friendly.  It seems that when you get to the point when you are wondering if you are on the right track, a reassuring sign always seems to turn up.  Major turns and junctures are usually very clearly marked in Alberta, so you can make an informed decision before embarking in a particular direction.  In BC, however, it seems like you already have to know where you are going to get anywhere!  Once you finally figure out how to get to your destination, through trial and error, a tip from someone or incredible powers of ESP, you will find plenty of signage!  Finding the ribbon for the trail to Atkins Cove was a struggle; but, once we were finally on the trail after getting lost several times, there were ribbons everywhere, and, at a point when we really didn’t need them because we could see the water!  What good is signage if it doesn’t give guidance to the lost!  I’ve experienced a similar frustration with highway signs in BC too:  certain needed signs are too far apart or only show up when I’m past doubt and nearly at my destination.  Oddly enough, as soon as we started walking about fifty metres on what we hoped was the Marble River Trail, we not only found signage, but a huge plaque with information and history about the place!  Go figure!  </p>

<p>We walked along the first part of the trail with our heads tilted up, in awe of this forest of very tall trees.  Though they were incredibly tall, they were not very wide—speaking of their relative youth.  They were also very uniform, looking like they had been farmed.  In December of 1907 this forest had been flattened by a hurricane, the catastrophe creating space for an inordinate amount of new growth all at once.  Because of the trees’ uniformity, it felt like we were in a kind of real life diorama­—something that looks real but not quite.  There was the occasional tall huge dead cedar left standing after the hurricanes, looking very archaic and full of character alongside it’s fresher, more nubile 108 year old younger generation companions.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/108oldyung.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>James and the 108 year old youngsters.</em></p>

<p>I did pretty well on the bike at first, stopping occasionally to go up a hill or over some rough stuff.  I was somewhat amazed at the narrowness of the trail, finding it tricky to maneuver between trees and over roots.  It is definitely a bike trail for the more serious mountain biker.  A couple of times James pushed the bike up very steep parts of the trail for me (he’s quite a chivalrous guy…a real keeper!).  I ended up going down a fairly steep hill and, thanks to a root that was protruding a little too high, I did a face plant into some ferns!  James said I did it all very gracefully, by not resisting the fall.  Luckily there was some moss under the ferns to make for a soft landing.  Chloe was concerned too, running right up to me to see if I was alright.  After a while the roots seemed to be more prevalent, either because of my perceptions after the fall, or because they actually were.   James told me to leave my bike and walk the rest of the way.  I kept wondering if the trail would end before my knees did and, lo and behold, we found signs (at the end—where else!)  One pointed to Emerald Pools, 1.2 km, and the other to Bear Falls, 75 m.  It was a no-brainer so we took the path to Bear Falls, though we remained awfully curious about Emerald Pools.  Oddly enough, at the end of the day, it turned out the walk (or the walk and bike ride) was good for my knee and it hurt way less than expected.  The next day my knee felt almost normal.  We might have been able to take on Emerald Pools.  I guess it’s true, that exercise is good for arthritis.  </p>

<p>Coming up on Bear Falls we were met with a powerful noise.  The water from the Marble River roared as it cut and carved its way around the huge boulders before spilling into a wide tranquil pool lower down.  Bear Falls is a natural fish ladder:  the falls are like steps, making it a little easier for the salmon to leap up against the current.  The water was rushing so hard though, they have quite a battle to face nevertheless!  Because of this, places like Bear Falls are a popular place for bears to hang out in the fall and fatten up on fish.  At the north side of the falls is a cement fish ladder built by Western Forest Products, giving the salmon a little more of a boost for reaching their destination and helping to increase the number of salmon that get born.   </p>

<p>Not satisfied seeing it from afar, we crawled right on to the rocks, carrying Chloe.  We sat in the sun and had a little rest and a snack surrounded by roaring churning water.  James then decided it was time to jump into the pool under the falls!  At first I thought he was kidding, then, I realized, he wasn’t!  I told him he was crazy, but I knew there was little I could do to stop him.  I joked that if he starts to drown I’m going to have to leave him there, because there is no way I’m going in that frigid water.  So he jumped into the water, swimming around, hooting and hollering either in ecstasy or in pain or both as I snapped away with his phone.  Not your average 55 year old!  Well, he didn’t drown.  He came back up with a big smile on his face.  I couldn’t stop shaking my head.  He said he liked it because it made him feel alive.  He encouraged me to try it.  I said no thanks and that I’ve experienced enough pain in my life to make me feel alive.  </p>

<p>We headed back, finding my bike where I left it.  By the end of the trail, I was starting to think more like a mountain biker and was riding more smoothly on the skinny trail.  It seemed by the last few hundred yards I was in my stride.  Chloe was getting pretty tired and protested several times by refusing to move any further.  We ended up having to pick her up and carry her for a ways.  James and I took turns carrying Chloe while the other rode or pushed the bike.  Chloe would then walk a little more until she staged another protest.   We realized that this 5 or 6 km hike was like a 30 km hike for someone her size.  By the end, she hardened up too, and walked the last stretch herself.  She probably sensed from us that we were at the end of the trail.  </p>

<p>We spent the rest of the evening eating smokies (it’s a good thing our normal everyday diet is low in cholesterol) and banana smores and calculating James’ numerology with a book I brought.  He’s overwhelmingly a 2 (he’s a 2 for his life path, destiny and personality number), which is about companionship and peace-making and suits him to a T!  I’m largely a 3 which is about self-expression, which makes sense being that I’m an artist and a writer.  An individualistic solitary “artsie,” I think if I wasn’t with a strong 2 like James, I’m sure there would be no hope for me at all!  James is not just committed to a relationship with me, but to the idea of relationships in general!  It’s been quite an education for me.  His mind is set up to do everything in pairs.  If he gets up to get a coffee, he always asks if I want one.  One time I got myself a coffee just for myself and got heck for it.  If he wants to go for a walk, then I should want to go for one too.  If I want to buy an ice cream cone, then he does too.  It can be a serious problem when it comes to eating though.  He would like us to eat the same food, in the same amounts and at the same frequency, except we have different metabolisms.  He can eat a zillion calories a day and not gain an ounce and I can gain weight just looking at food!  He feels very uncomfortable eating to satisfaction when he knows I have to be a little bit hungry for the better part of the day.  Very often he has refused to eat himself because I wouldn’t.  It took a few indoctrination sessions, but he’s learned to help himself to a hearty late night snack (but looking visibly uncomfortable about it) while I sip my tea and look on.  Every once in a while though, he forgets himself and tries to share!  There’s no two ways about it:  he’s a 2 through and through!   </p>

<p>As darkness fell, we started a game of chess.  James considers himself “pretty good” at chess and thought beating me would be a breeze.  He did beat me, but I <i>did</i> make him sweat.  Practically each time it was his move, he sat there frozen seemingly forever, thinking about his next move without even twitching.  He just looked like a statue, while his brain quietly calculated away like a computer.  The chess game lasted until it got very dark.  We had to bring out all the flashlights and lamps we had and arrange them around our chess board so we could see what we were doing.  </p>

<p><b>June 16, 2015</b> </p>

<p>We spent a leisurely morning just hanging out.  I was writing my recollections and James was reading the paper and his book and we were both just generally being lazy.  Such a thing is quite a novelty for me, as I am juggling several part time jobs, volunteer work and writing and illustrating a copious amount of books.  I originally came out to Port Alice hoping for a slower pace of life…it didn’t work! When it was time to go kayaking James wanted to dump just a little water on the fire.  I had to give him my little Smokey the Bear spiel.  Not too happily, he took a bucket and went down the embankment to get some water.  I had to stand my ground, because I didn’t want us to be liable for a forest fire, financially or morally.  When disasters happen like the Fort McMurray wildfires, you don’t want to be the one that started it, even if you don’t get caught!  With major forest fire disasters, however, there is always a major investigation after where no stone is left unturned.  Sooner or later, who or what caused it gets found out!  </p>

<p>Sometimes it strikes me that humans are programmed for disaster as, it turned out, Pinch Creek wasn’t the only place we ended up putting out someone else’s campfire in high or extreme hazard in 2015. In fact, we had to put a campfire left by some campers a couple of sites down from ours during this trip!  They made no attempts whatsoever to put it out and it was still producing quite a bit of smoke as they left.  Perhaps this happens because humans have an unconscious desire for drama and emotional intensity.  Maybe people are more concerned about escaping the authorities than the actual consequences of their actions.  Perhaps this happens too often simply because people don’t have enough information on how forest fires work.  Forestry ministries tend to give the public a stern message about making sure the campfire is out, sounding threatening and authoritarian and all that, without providing the nitty gritty.  I think they should appeal to people’s intelligence, rather than trigger their propensity to be defiant.  I think they would get better results with a little education, teaching people some interesting facts about fire behaviour.  Since reading my write up about forest fires in my Link River account written this past winter, James has become much more cooperative making sure the fire is completely out.  </p>

<p>We went kayaking by the salmon hatchery again under sunny skies, discovering little coves that we had missed the last time.  In another cove, Chloe’s big antennae ears perked up and we knew something was up.  Her ears directed us to a deer drinking water from the lake.  In the same cove we came across some marsh marigolds and I did a little art photography (with a camera phone!).  In another little cove, James felt himself rise up as he scraped logs underneath (or possibly a lake monster!) so we backed up and got out of there in a hurry before we ended up stuck and needing to swim (or getting eaten by the lake monster!) .   </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/marigolds3.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>Marsh Marigolds 3.</em></p>

<p>We came around to a point that had a couple of docks, one old and weather worn with a couple of holes in it, and another newly built, both of which can be seen from the Port Alice highway.  This looks like the locale for a future cabin or at least a hang-out for some campers as there was some human paraphernalia and garbage lying around.  It was decided this was our snacking spot so we landed. As I stepped out of my kayak— much more gracefully than ever before— I felt my right foot getting sucked down!  I’ve always had unusually fast reflexes that seem to really work for me in a pinch.  Without hardly thinking about it, I somehow threw my body weight forward and landed in a heap on the beach!  It was a fraction of a second of pure scariness!  James must have thought I was having a seizure!  When I told James about the quicksand he had to feel for it, the silly goose!  He confirmed my suspicions.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/jamesnchloe.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>James and Chloe checking out the docks.</em></p>

<p>After our snack and a few pictures taken on the docks, we headed leisurely back, talking about our exes, past relationships, open-relationships, committed relationships, dysfunctional relationships and those sorts of things.  Being on kayaks in the middle of a North Island lake is a great place for in depth philosophical conversation.  </p>

<p>As we started to pack up back at the campsite, I was feeling very sad to leave.  This was such a cozy campsite.  I wouldn’t have minded spending a couple more days just “hanging out”…but we have schedules.  My kitties were probably missing me too.   I put my hand in the fire, and it was still a bit warm from the morning even though we had put quite a bit of water on it.  It shows how persistent a fire can be in hot dry weather!  James shook his head.  He begrudgingly helped me as we dumped all the remaining water we had on it, plus a couple of buckets from the river.  I shudder to think that, if I hadn’t put my hand in the fire, we would have been leaving behind a live unattended fire in extreme hazard!  The Marble River trail could have had a whole new look in 2015!    </p>

	     <p><b>June 6, 2015</b></p>

<p>This is a story about two goofballs (and one Chihuahua) who got lost again, and again, and again. Even though it was a weekday, we were eager to make use of our new kayaks.  Our first intent was to explore the inlet behind the mill.  James loaded the kayaks on both vehicles by himself while I was working at the school and we took off after.  We drove up to a dock in front of the effluent treatment holding tank; but, as soon as we got out, James nixed the plan.  He admitted that he didn’t know what he was thinking, with the wind kicking up some significant waves on the inlet.  Our next brain wave was to drive behind the mill and launch into the inlet there, hoping the mill would act as a block for the waves and produce calmer waters.  James stopped on the road to have a discussion with me about the possible futility of our efforts (the theme for the day!).  Finally we decided we should give Atkins Cove a try since it wasn’t too far out of town and it would be sheltered.  </p>

<p>We drove north along Marine Drive and made a left turn on a gravel road just past the gas station.  To help maintain the mood of “lostness” of this story, I will give you accurate directions to Atkins Cove at the end.  The first part of the trip was gravel road and I was feeling fine.  James probably told me the directions before we left, but they didn’t sink in.  I wasn’t that worried, as he seemed to know where he was going.  After we passed a short road that lead down to the shore, it made sense to me that it should have been the route to our cove.  I tried to stop James by honking and honking.   Finally, I got his attention by stopping the truck and waiting.  He finally backed up to see what had happened to me.  With the radio on and the windows closed, he couldn’t hear me.  He told me to flash my brights the next time.  He said the turnoff was 12 kilometres from town and that he was watching the odometer.  He told me his instructions from a friend were to drive past a side road with a cable across it (with a red ribbon on it which wasn’t actually red but pink) and take the next left.  </p>

<p>After our drive along Neroutsos Main with marvelous views, we turned onto a decommissioned logging road and got swallowed by trees!  It was a very overgrown road that James jokingl y called “a goat trail.” The road was firm and drivable but the branches scratched the sides of our vehicles, making an eerie screechy sound that seemed to ask, “Do you know where you are going?”  As we drove along, methinks I may have seen the elusive trail ribbon that James was looking for but missed.  Only I didn’t know that was what we were looking for!  We kept driving deeper and deeper into this jungle.  Every so often James would have to get out of his car and throw or kick rocks out of the path of his little Toyota Camry.  At a couple of spots we had to remove branches and trees from the road.  One tree was still attached to its base and no amount of pushing or pulling would get it to snap and be out of our way.  We tried to push it together with all our might, but it would just swing back to its favoured position.  We bemoaned that we had not brought a Swede saw or an axe.  It was something we did not consider because we were supposedly on a “short day trip.”  Some short day trip: it was beginning to feel like a trek into the abyss!  Unfortunately, we did not have to be in that dilemma as, as that point—we would find out later—we had passed the ribbon that marked the trail to Atkins Cove and were well on our way to nowhere!  Finally, I suggested he hold the tree as much out of the way as possible while I drive both vehicles past.  It would have been a great idea, if we had actually needed to do it!  </p>

<p>Once we passed the immovable snag, the trees seemed to squeeze even more tightly around our vehicles and we were dodging bear crap everywhere!   We came to a fork in the road.  We debated and debated which one to take, and decided to take the one to the right.  When that one turned into a dead end, we went back and took the one to the left.  At the end of it all, they were both dead ends!  “The one less travelled” and the one more travelled were both equally futile!  After all that we took a third fork which turned out to be futile as well!  Actually, the truth of the matter was that none of them were travelled at all!  Maybe they were travelled a lot once upon a time by logging trucks, but no more, except perhaps for the occasional batch of hunters on quads, and maybe…goats.  </p>

<p>On the trail to the right, the branches seemed to squeeze even more tightly around our vehicles!  They ended up swiping the foamy under the Eskia off the car.  I honked and honked to get James to stop.  In an especially thick patch of trees, we put the foamy back in place while fighting off groping branches.  Finally, we came to an open area and saw a tiny patch of water.  I climbed on top of the truck to see what I could see, but I could see little more.  With the situation seriously challenging relationship harmony, we took short walks to check things out.  We found a good place to turn our vehicles around, and drove back through the too thick trees.  I hit a bump and lost a foamy and a strap and drove quite a ways without realizing it.  James honked and honked at me to no avail.  Finally, when I noticed he wasn‘t following me, I stopped the truck and waited for my lecture on leaving the window closed and playing the radio too loud.    </p>

<p>Irritated, dejected, inclined to call it quits and go home (though I wondered if we were all that sure of the way home anymore), all three of us hopped in the truck and took that left fork, which was also a dead end, but, thankfully, a shorter one.  Then, dumb and dumber decided to go back to third road, which lead to a slightly longer road with a dead end.  With a bit of panic starting to set in we decided to call it quits and go home to get more information.  Not long after we passed the tree that wouldn’t move, I was coasting along and noticed James wasn’t following.  I put the truck in reverse and discovered that he had parked his car on a small pullout.  Like a man redeemed, he joyfully and ecstatically informed me that he had found the ribbon.  By then I wasn’t in the mood to be ecstatic about anything, but I thought I’d better not rain on his parade.  He said he noticed it because he could see water through the trees.  It made him look around and notice the ribbon.  I then informed him that I had seen that ribbon on the way in (that I didn’t know we were looking for) and it produced a chorus of moaning and groaning.  </p>

<p>He suggested we tromp through the woods to look for the cove.  I was only wearing crocs and was no longer in the mood for exploring, so James went alone.  He came back not long after, jubilantly announcing that he found a well worn trail. Though somewhat disheartened, I went along with his suggestion to take just the tandem kayak.  We both carried the Manitou to the ribbon in the trees on the road.  Just across from it was an archway of branches and leaves that framed the entrance to the trail.  If one did not have some instructions and a basic familiarity with the BC backwoods, finding this is pretty much like finding a needle in a haystack!  James jubilantly pulled the Manitou down to the shore like it was as light as a balloon.  The trail was well padded down, as it looked like it had been used by a considerable number of people pulling kayaks.  We were assured of where we were going by the numerous fluorescent ribbons tied to trees along the trail, but the trail was quite distinct as well.  </p>

<p>Arriving at our lost lagoon, we felt victorious!  Looking around, we released many sighs and “oooohs” and “ahhhs.”  I suppose what is special about Atkins Cove is its very tranquil out of the way feeling.  It is enclosed by land masses, with only a narrow exit to the inlet.  Protected from the wind, the water was serene and still.  Out in the middle of the cove were a couple of abandoned rafts from some kind of mining operation, which really didn’t mar the beauty of the peaceful secluded setting.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/atkins_cove_2.jpg" alt="atkinscove"><em>Atkin&#39;s Cove.</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/atkinscove.jpg" alt="atkinscove"><em>Me and Little Miss Big Ears.</em></p>

<p>We packed up our Manitou to give it a run with all of us in it, even though it was supposedly made to hold no more than 120 pounds in the front cockpit.  James had previously checked the Necky website and found out that the Manitou was capable of holding a total of 500 pounds.  Between the two of us, we still had about a hundred pounds of leeway.  I was a few pounds heavier, so I sat in the back and James sat in the front.  Chloe sat on some blankets between my legs in the back cockpit.  As soon as we were both in, the kayak was noticeably low in the water.  Too much tilting one way or the other would have meant a flooded cockpit and a rescue operation.  </p>

<p>Surprisingly, though the Manitou is smaller than a full fledged double kayak, we were able to paddle rhythmically without knocking paddles much.  I basically copied James’ paddling, except when I became preoccupied by Chloe’s restlessness.  Because we were two paddlers, Chloe was getting dripped on too much!  Chloe doesn’t like getting wet!  She loves going for walks in sunshine and she doesn’t mind going for walks when it’s cold; but, when it’s raining, she will go to the end of the carport and that’s it!  We end up having to pick her up and take her around a corner so she can’t see home; then, she will walk the usual route back home in the rain.  </p>

<p>We took a short trip around the point and followed the shore.  We came across a a small beach and had our snack of cheese, gluten free rice crackers for me, granola bars for James and a couple of near beers.  We offered Chloe some cheese but, amazingly, she didn’t want to eat it.  She was probably still perturbed by her uncomfortable travel accommodations. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/viewofneurosisfrompicnic.jpg" alt="view of neroutsos"><em>View of Neroutsos Inlet from our picnic spot.</em></p>

<p>Looking around from that beach we saw numerous possibilities for kayaking.  There was Drake Island with Pamphlet Cove nestled in the middle of it.  Supposedly, there are the ruins of an old hotel there.  Farther west is the Quatsino Sound and the Quatisino Provincial Park.  To the north, around Evenson Point, is the remote village of Quatsino.  To the east of there is Hecate Cove, Marble River Provincial Park and the Quatsino Straight.   As kayakers, we had our work cut out for us!   Atkins Cove is a good launch point for travelling to these areas as; otherwise, you would have to spend all day paddling down the Neroutsos Inlet.  Because of inflow winds, the inlet most often gets choppy in the afternoon.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/darkisland.jpg" alt="Drake Island"><em>View of Drake Island in the evening light.</em></p>

<p>Getting lost used up a lot of time.  The sun was starting to set.  We had to cut our kayak trip short and head back around the point.  At the first part of the journey, Chloe wasn’t getting too wet, thanks to her fleece blanket.  Towards the end though, the fleece was soaked.  She tried to hide herself in the covered area between two cockpits, but that didn’t work very well either.  She came out of the cockpit and peered over the edge of the boat, looking like she was ready to jump.  I ended up leaving the paddling to James while I held her in my arms.  </p>

<p>As we came close to the shore where we launched, James paddled slowly, trying to stretch out this usually short kayaking trip. We checked out the mining rafts in Atkins, trying to picture how the operation worked.  Just before getting to our landing spot, we heard rushing water behind some willows.  We were wondering if it was something like the Disappearing Waterfall that is in another part of this area, but it turned out to be only a stream hidden in the trees.  When we figured it out, we had to untangle our paddles from some water vegetation.  We then slowly and reluctantly drifted back to our launch point.  Even though it was still quite light in the cove itself, it was feeling like night on the trail.  James pulled the kayak back up by himself.  By the time he got to the top, he was definitely huffing and puffing.  It was a lot different going up!  I had offered to help; however, he wanted to sprint hard and fast.  I have an arthritic knee and it would have made the going too slow for Mr. Fast Twitch Muscle Sprinter Guy.  </p>

<p>As we loaded up, James spent quite a bit of time swearing at himself for missing the ribbon.  James can be pretty hard on himself sometimes so that I often have to say to him, “It’s OK to make mistakes.”  Heck, if people didn’t make mistakes, I wouldn’t be able to entertain you with a silly story like this one!  Besides, the heightened emotion brought on by our misadventures, made this a very memorable trip.  I now look back on it with a little bit of nostalgia.  It really was an adventure because of the many unknowns, even though Atkins Cove should have otherwise been a very tame trip.  </p>

<p>On the gravel road part I saw a black bear picking salmon berries before it ran away.  James missed it because he was a bit behind me.  </p>

<p>When we got back to my place, the people who gave James instructions how to get to Atkins Cove passed by (speak of the devil) while I was watering the garden and James was washing the kayaks.  They admitted they got lost for a while too.  James stopped beating himself up after that.  </p>

<p><b><i>So What Have We Learned?</b></i></p>

<p>So what have we learned from this?  First of all, the value of proper planning and preparedness!  Have at least a couple of maps or more.  Especially when it comes to logging roads, as there can be inaccuracies and even major discrepancies.  Several times we encountered roads that weren’t on the map, roads on the map that weren’t there and roads in the wrong places.  Plan your trip as accurately as you can.  Discuss it in depth and check and double check your instructions.  Be willing to question instructions, maps and yourself.  </p>

<p>Second, make sure all adult members of your party know where they are going and how to get there.  There may be some confusion as how to interpret directions from any source.  The more everybody knows the better.  </p>

<p>Third, tell someone where you are going and when you plan to be back.  The movie 127 Hours is a good example of what can go wrong if you don’t.  It is about how Aaron Ralston went hiking in the canyons of Utah one day without telling anybody.  He ended up trapped in a crevice by a rock that landed on his arm.  Since no one knew of his whereabouts, or even that he was gone, he ended up having to amputate his own arm with a dull instrument in order to get help.  Normally, our cat sitter is the one who knows where we are going and when we plan to be back.  When we went to Atkins Cove “on the fly,” however, we were only planning to be gone for the afternoon and didn’t need a cat sitter.  No one had any idea of where we went, or even that we were gone!  </p>

<p>Fourth, make sure you have extra provisions:  food, water, proper clothing, proper foot ware, a first aid kit, matches, blankets, etc. in case you are stuck somewhere longer than expected.  </p>

<p>Fifth, if you are genuinely lost, a good way to get found is to start a campfire in the middle of the day.  When I was a forest fire lookout, I reported a good number of fires that ended up being just some campers having a wiener roast.  If you have a good sized fire, the column can go up pretty high and be seen for many kilometres by a fire lookout or a passing aircraft or even a member of the public on the ground.  There are lookouts all over Alberta, so that there is really not much area that can’t be seen by someone in the summer.  There are a handful of active lookouts in BC, about twenty (at one time there was 320!); but, there is a lot going on in the air and on the ground.  The forests of BC and Alberta are interspersed with industry, including logging, fire-fighting, oil and gas and mining operations,   aviation, shipping, farming, tourism and so on.  It is probably similar in other provinces.   There are people everywhere!  In the “wilderness” they are just spaced farther apart.  Be wary, though, about starting a fire in extreme hazard or during a fire ban.  For one thing, your bones could end up being tinder sticks; and, for another, you could be sued millions of dollars for the cost of fighting a fire you started.  I would rather be stuck a few more days in the bush than have to deal with either of those two problems.  I’d avoid starting a fire in windy conditions.  I’ve seen many a small fire grow to an enormous size in high or even moderate winds.  </p>

<p>I read the kid’s book <i>Hatchet</i> by Gary Paulsen some years back.  It was an enjoyable read about a teenager lost in the bush.  Although time has faded my recollection of the events in the book, I remember thinking that the only thing this kid has to do is to light a small bonfire in the middle of the day and his rescue probably would have been instantaneous!  Some lady in a lookout tower or a pilot would have been obliged to report it as a possible forest fire.  It would have to be investigated—and—the lost is found!   Hikers and hunters usually light their campfires in the evening, so, if a fire is burning in the middle of the day outside a designated camping area, it is more likely presumed to be a forest fire…and forest fires get a lot of attention!  There are even forest fire fighting operations in the Northwest Territories, the Yukon and Nunavut!  Practically every square kilometer of bush in Canada is monitored, patrolled or checked on at some point in the summer!  You are never really alone!  If you are lost in the bush and think the only thing you are going to meet is your maker, you are probably blowing the situation out of proportion.  </p>

<p>Sixth, trust your gut.  If you are going down a path and you are overcome by a feeling that something is very wrong, trust it.  In some cases, your guts might be the only thing you have to go on, as the back roads of BC are confusing and not well marked.  Our guts told us to give up and go back home, and that’s how we found Atkins Cove.  </p>

<p><b><i>How to Get to Atkins Cove</b></i></p>

<p>On Valentine’s Day 2016, we took a trip out to Atkins Cove to make sure our directions were clear.  A lot had changed.  The road had been cleared.  We later found out that a group of people are clearing trails as part of Port Alice’s new tourist initiative.  James has recently signed up to be part of this group.  We even found a kayak trail going down to Kokwina Cove on the opposite side of Atkins, which makes a more direct kayak route to the village of Quatsino and Drake Island.  You can even access the Quatsino Narrows from there, if you are willing to brave them, to get to Rupert Arm and Holberg Inlet.  To kayak the Quatsino Narrows you have to time the tides just right or it could be very hazardous indeed, and you should definitely not do it with a Chihuahua!   The Quatsino Narrows are very “narrow” (hence the name), and, when massive amounts of tidal waters pass through them, it can make for a lot of turbulence.  It is through that narrow passage that enough water has to pass through to fill up and empty two huge inlets!  The Quatsino Narrows is a trip for an experienced kayaker only, though James keeps suggesting we do them some day.  We’ll see.  </p>

<p>To get to Atkins Cove you have to get on the Neroutsos Main, which is a logging road running north and south along the east side of Neroutsos Inlet.  There are three roads that lead to the Neroutsos Main:  one starts from the highway, the other starts just a little past the gas station, and another goes through the community of Jeune Landing (pronounced “June Landing” here).  Whichever one you take will eventually lead you to a wooden bridge at the start of Neroutsos Main.  If the bridge is kilometre zero, it is a total of 11 kilometres to the pull out at the head of the trail to Atkins Cove.  As you drive, you will soon notice a fork in the road that goes up to the right.  This is Quarry Main.  Don’t take it if you want to get to Atkins Cove.  It will not lead you to Atkins Cove, but it will lead you up to a beautiful lookout point higher up the mountain that you might want to check out another time.  This is how I got the pictures of Neroutsos Inlet and Quatsino Sound for my introduction.  You can make it up there most of the way with a two-wheel drive to a nice picnic spot.  Only the very last part, to another picnic spot, you will need a four wheel drive.  After passing the fork to Quarry Main, you will drive past the Quatsino log sort, which is a rather interesting sight to behold with heavy machinery and piles of logs in gentle hues of deep brown.  You may want to stop your vehicle just to spend some time looking at it.</p>

<p>Keep going on the Neroutsos main for 9.8 kilometres.  About halfway to Atkins Cove you will pass a picnic spot with a good lookout point and an odd plaque screwed to tree stump. </p>

<p>When you get to 9.8 kilometres, you should be able to look back over your shoulder down to the left and see an overgrown road with a cable tied across it.  There are several pink ribbons hanging from the cable.  The turn off is the next left after this one, about 50 metres ahead.  We found a “crew working” sign at the turnoff and much of the vegetation that squeezed around our vehicles was all cleared.  There is still a pink ribbon at the head of the trail down to Atkins Cove.   Another kayak trail head to Kokwina Cove is about 200 metres north of the Atkins Cove pull out, but it is not, as yet, marked (we didn’t have fluorescent ribbon with us).  You could deposit your kayaks at the head of the Kokwina Cove trail, kayak around Evenson Point and land in Atkins Cove for a little round trip.  For an overnight trip, you might want to include Drake Island and the village of Quatsino.  Just be careful around Quattische Island that is on the west side of Kokwina, as the waters get narrow enough to cause complications.  That area is actually part of the Quatsino Narrows.  You would have to time the tides to do it safely.  I suggest that you consult The BC Coast Explorer and marine trail guide, vol. 1,  by John Kimantas— probably the most thorough Vancouver Island kayaking guide you can get—to find out exactly how to go about it.  If you want to play it safe, you should probably take the Atkins Cove side.  </p>

	  <title>Link River: Secrets of the Forest Revealed</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>For our first official kayaking trip, we decided on Link River and Alice Lake.     Because they were familiar and close to home, we thought they would be a not-so-terrifying option for our first time.  A hop, skip and a jump from Port Alice, Link River is a very short shallow rocky river joining Victoria Lake and Alice Lake.  Of the two lakes, Alice Lake is smaller.  Not only that, but, according to local folklore, Victoria Lake is rumoured to be “bottomless” (or close to it) and we thought that it might be a bit too adventurous for beginning kayakers.  The Link River campsite, with the river to the south joining into Alice Lake to the east, has very tall coniferous trees and a forest floor covered with ferns, giving it all the brooding exoticness of an Emily Carr painting. </p>

<p><b>May 28, 2015</b> </p>

<p>We were concerned about the campsite filling up so we went down to set up camp on Thursday.  James would stay there Thursday night with Chloe and I would go back home to do my lunch supervisor job on Friday and come after.   The first hurdle we had to face when kayaking for the first time was how to transport our kayaks.  We didn’t have the money to buy fancy dancy kayak carriers, so we were forced to improvise.  A while ago we bought some foam supports at Canadian Tire that were suggested to us by a fellow kayaker.  They are basically a couple of pieces of foam that you stick on the top of your vehicle for the kayak to sit on.  Once it is all strapped in place, the kayak is fairly secure.  They are cheap, are not a permanent solution, but work in a pinch.  We didn’t think they would work for the truck (but we eventually found out, they did), so we were trying to come up with an alternative. </p>

<p>James found a real estate sandwich board sign among the junk in my carport. I was possibly saving it for selling my book at craft fairs, but hadn’t made a final decision about it yet.  I found it at our transfer station that is coined the “Port Alice Walmart.”  The transfer station has a covered give and take area, making it a great place to “shop” in Port Alice.  Especially during the time that Port Alice was a rich mill town, you could find amazing stuff there!  Not only is most of my furniture acquired from the transfer station, but many of the materials for renovating my house--drywall mud, paint, doors, etc,--has been retrieved from there.  And because I have a small house, I also had to leave a lot of stuff there to make room for the new stuff I found. </p>

<p>James anchored the sandwich board to the end of the truck box with a ratchet strap, so it could work as an extension beyond the tailgate.  After putting a couple of the foam supports onto the sandwich board, we lifted the Manitou onto it.  It was sticking way beyond our truck box, so we slanted it to the passenger’s side.  We didn’t want to knick anybody while taking any of the sharp curves on the winding Port Alice road.  We wound one strap around the bridge between the two cockpits and hinged it to the tie-down cleats near the front of the box.  I got an idea to lasso the back of the kayak with two straps and tie them to the cleats at each side of the back of the box.  James tied the nose to a cleat at the front of the truck box with super heavy string.  He secured the foamies with duct tape and, with that-- though the Manitou didn’t look very classy--it was definitely secure.  We then loaded Eskia onto the car, loaded up our camping supplies and headed down to Link River. </p>

<p>To get to Link River from any direction, you have to travel the Port Alice road, Highway 30, until you see very noticeable signs that say “Link River.”  That’s hard to miss.  Once you head east on the Link River road, it gets a little tricky, especially if you are not used to driving the back roads of BC.  You basically have to travel down logging roads to get there--but the forest is full of logging roads.  Be careful where you turn and which fork you take.  If you take the wrong road you can end up halfway to Dimension X or some other tricky place like a narrow road on the top of a mountain with no room to turn around and go down (I will tell about that experience a little later).  Link River, however, is pretty tame as forest back roads in the area go.  There are three forks in the road, but they all have “official” district signs pointing to Link River.  There are also a lot of home-made signs to help you out as well.  It’s hard for anything to go wrong.   Link River is a short drive from the highway, so if you find yourself driving for hours and hours and not getting anywhere, you took the wrong turn (we have stories like that too). </p>

<p>At this point I think I should take some time to inform you about another hazard of logging roads: logging trucks!  Logging trucks have the right of way.  That means if you run into one on a one lane dirt road you have to make room for it…even if it means driving into the ditch, that is, if there is one!  Sometimes there isn’t one, and you and your vehicle will become a pancake!   Sometimes they will stop if they can; but, the g-forces created by their loads make it difficult.  Because loggers maintain banker’s hours, a good way to avoid them is to travel after 6 pm on the week days or on weekends.  We have forestry companies to thank for the roads that lead us to our back woods adventures, so we have to respect their jurisdiction over them.  They are not so much of a concern going to Link River.  There is a lot of tourist traffic on the Link River road and the logging companies seem to make adjustments for that.  Wherever you go in the back woods, keep your eyes and your ears open, stay close to your side of the road, and keep a look out for escape routes. </p>

<p>When we arrived at Link River there was practically no one around, so we had our pick of campsites.  It was almost a problem because we took a long time checking out all the sites--which were all very beautiful—and deciding on which to use.  We finally settled on the place with a bunch of large sculptural stumps, one of which had steps carved into it.  After setting up camp, I left James and Chloe behind and went home with James’ car.  Not thinking too clearly, we traded keys so that he had my truck keys and I had his car keys.  I didn’t realize it at the time that I was giving him my house keys!  I went all the way home, drove into my carport, seeing my cat, Mr. Magoo, waiting at the door for his chow, and I couldn’t get in!  I just skipped the swearing and beating myself up part.  I apologized to Mr. Magoo, turned around and went back all the way to Link River.</p>

<p>By the time I got back to Link River, I discovered James had moved the campsite.  He said it had too much northern exposure and was too windy.  With the stumps too, it felt kind of eerie and especially damp.  When I finally got home, Mr. Magoo had given up waiting and was on another cat adventure.  I spent the evening thoroughly watering my garden, which included my vegetable garden in the back, the hydrangea garden in the front and all the potted herbs and tomatoes on my balcony.  On a hot dry day, watering all my gardens can take two hours or more.  When I came here from Alberta, I assumed that it rained here all the time and that I wouldn’t need my garden hose.  Luckily, I brought it anyway.  In Port Alice especially, we can get a good share of hot sunny weather in the summer.  I like to call Port Alice the “California of the North Island.”  After seeing James and me pack up our vehicles for camping the day before, my neighbours looked at me oddly.  I had the feeling that they thought James and I had a fight. When they asked, “how was kayaking?” I explained that we had just set up camp and that I would go there after work tomorrow.  Even when I told them that, I had the feeling they didn’t really believe me. </p>

<p>I got caught up in doing this and that, leaving a note and food out for the cat sitter, and doing some last minute watering.  By the time I made it to Link River, it was quite late in the afternoon.   Taking advantage of very calm water, James and Chloe had already kayaked across the lake to the Pinch Creek campsite.  Chloe was cool as a cucumber on her first official kayak journey, burying herself under her blankets in her little Chihuahua cockpit and napping as James paddled across the lake.  By the time I arrived, the water was choppy.  We debated about whether or not we should take it on.  We decided to just take a short trip, which ended up being not that short. </p>

<p>This wasn’t our absolute first time on kayaks.  When we were camping at Rupert Arm early in the spring, we borrowed another camper’s double kayak for a good long day.  For our second time, we took turns trying out our Eskia on Neroutsos Inlet the day we bought it.  That day, however, it was windy and miserable and raining a bit.  One thing I will always remember about that day was when James tried to cast off on the kayak still on his feet and trying to casually slip into the cockpit as he was drifting.  We now know that when you cast off in a kayak, your butt should be firmly inside!  I think I tried to mention something about that; but, in the short space of time it took to ignore me, James’ face ended up in the water!  It was April and the water must have been very cold to fall into! </p>

<p>Had we not known any better, we probably would have said this was a pretty hard paddle.  These days, we tend to avoid kayaking when the water is that rough, if we can.  The waves were nearly a foot high, and we could only manage by cutting straight through them.   Luckily, because James grew up and lived on the Island most of his life, he knew that much.   I threw myself into the paddling job at hand, and found myself ending up way ahead of James.  He wasn’t expecting me to be such a vigorous paddler, perhaps being that I was an old lady and all!  Actually, neither was I!  He kept wondering when I would tire out, as I seemed to go on and on like the Energizer bunny.  We then got into a conversation about “sprinters” vs. “marathoners.”  James has always been fast on his feet; he’s the sprinter.  Even today, he can run a lot faster than many thirty year olds.  I, on the other hand, am not fast, but I can go at a constant steady pace for long distances.  I won ribbons for long distance running in high school and I participated in a couple of 200 km MS bike marathons in Alberta when I was in my thirties.  James introduced me to the idea of “fast twitch” and “slow twitch” muscles.  People who have fast twitch muscles, like James, can produce a lot of power in a short space of time.  My muscles likely twitch more slowly, which allow me to go on longer at a steady pace.  I’ve always been fair to middling when it comes to sports and track and field.  We realized, however, that if I had been introduced to paddling young enough and had had the right opportunities, I might have been able to dream of going into the Olympics.  Instead, I am now a geriatric paddler writing a blog!  Can’t complain.  Paddling is paddling. </p>

<p>I’m much more graceful at getting in and out of the kayak now, but, then, I struggled to get out.  James always had to help me those first times and I probably moved in ways that were very unladylike.  For James, it must have seemed very much like helping an ox out of a kayak!  Getting in and out of the kayak is a skill that requires some practice.  The most common way to do it is to straddle the kayak, lean forward and engage your stomach muscles to get lift.  Part of my awkwardness was also due to the fact that I was a prairie chicken, unfamiliar with boating in general.  James was graceful at exiting the kayak from the start. </p>

<p>It was early evening when we came back, so it was time to start a campfire and have supper.  When it comes to making a campfire and setting up a camp kitchen, I have to sit back, snuggle with Chloe and let James have full control.  You might call him an over-aged boy scout.  As a child he was very involved in boy scouts and even went on camping trips in the winter in deep snow with his troops.  He still embodies those old boy scout values of nobility and honourability.  I’ve always had a lot of upper body strength and have been able to lift practically anything any guy my size can lift.  Though I’m in my fifties and some of my strength has waned, I can still lift a heavy object if I have to.  Being with James, however, he will quickly jump in and lift heavier objects before I do like I was some petite helpless damsel in distress!  When there is something both of us can and should lift together, he won’t give me much of a chance to help him and will move it single-handedly.  I find this state of affairs quite amusing.  I’m actually getting a little bit lazy these days, though “lazy” is not really in my DNA.  I will enjoy this situation as much as I can before he gets any the wiser. </p>

<p>James may have been lord and master of the campfire and the camp kitchen, but I provided the entertainment.  After supper, I brought out some cards and poker chips and we played until it got dark and James cleaned me out of all my poker chips.  Because I spent a few seasons working in a mountain lookout with my son, I have a lot of board and card games.  I am now a firm believer in the positive social value of games.  Too much of our entertainment these days is people sitting in front of a screen like zombies and tuning one another out.  With board and card games there is more social interaction and mental stimulation.  It’s also a great way to get to know someone you’ve just met too.  On one of our first dates I asked James for a Scrabble game and I’m sure he thought it was very peculiar.  He didn’t really see the light until sometime during the winter of 2015, when I reintroduced Scrabble during a power failure.  Sometime after that we started playing Scrabble quite regularly and one day, like a big kid, he spouted, “This is fun.” </p>

<p><b>May 29, 2015</b></p>

<p>We headed south on very calm waters in the morning, James in the Eskia and I in the Manitou with Chloe.  After we launched, Chloe realized her daddy was in the other kayak and was a little upset.  She whined and whined and tried to reach out of her cockpit towards him.  We used firm and commanding voices to make her stay put.   It wasn’t long before Chloe turned around under her fleece blanket and, protected from any rogue raindrops and splashing water, went down for her nap.  We headed south toward the Benson River.  An image that has stuck in my mind is of James gliding into a cove with cattails and giggling like a little boy.  One can go just about anywhere with a kayak!  From there we came to the mouth of the Benson River and went up a little bit until it our bottoms were scraping rocks.  After a rest break on a rocky island, we headed to Pinch Creek at the southeast end of Alice Lake. </p>

<p>Arriving at the Pinch Creek campsite, we came upon a ghastly sight if you have a fire-fighting background like I do!  There was not a single person in sight, but there was a campfire smoldering away in a very high to extreme forest fire hazard!  Granted, it was amongst a bunch of boulders; however, it still had potential for disaster.  It seems there are two important things that people don’t realize when they leave a smoldering fire: the weather is fickle and dirt burns!  It may have been calm that day, but a calm day can turn into a hurricane, re-enlivening the fire and sending it into the forest canopy.  Even an increase of 30 or 40 km per hour, or a few degrees drop in relative humidity can significantly change fire behaviour.  As for dirt: the forest floor is composed of a lot of flammable things like dried leaves and twigs and the far reaching roots of nearby trees.  If some heat from a campfire reaches a root, it basically becomes a coaxial cable for combustion.  Sometime later a nearby tree can suddenly explode into flames seemingly for no reason!  Another little known fact about fires that people should know about is that if you have any heat at all, even two tiny molecules bumping together to produce half a degree of heat, it is still technically a fire!  It might die, or, it may grow.  Because of this, fires can burn without producing smoke for days, weeks, months, even years!  I’m definitely not kidding!  A fire can remain in the ground over the winter and come up the next spring!  A coal seam fire can burn for several years, even decades!  When some of that coal heat finds a crack in the ground and forest fuels, it produces smoke and reveals itself.  I’ve heard of stories of coal seam fires burning for a hundred years!  I checked out the internet and apparently there is a coal seam fire at Burning Mountain in Australia that has been burning for an estimated 6000 years! </p>

<p>James and I decided we would put out the fire, but have our lunch first.  We found a nice stump to sit on as we munched away on cheese and rice cakes, grapes and non-alcoholic beer.  As we ate, Chloe checked out the surroundings for any messages left by other critters, and then left a few herself.  She joined us for her doggie snack and to beg for some of ours.  We later perused the treed part of the campsite.</p>

<p>If Link River campsite has the brooding exoticness of an Emily Carr painting, the Pinch Creek site has it twice as much!   It is not as accessible as Link River.  One has to travel a little further down a logging road to get to it, or get to it by boat.  It seemed to have extra ferns, extra matted old man’s hairs hanging from the branches and less traces of human existence.  It was like a forgotten room in the back of an old house that is built up with cobwebs and dust.  And just like that forgotten room in the back of an old house, Pinch Creek seemed to have more than its fair share of spirits!  This was definitely the domain of beings who wanted to stay away from people! 
 After making use of the facilities in the form of a very beaten up, run down, leaning and very smelly outhouse that hadn’t been serviced probably in thirty years (It was so decrepit--it was kind of a novelty), we headed for the shore and our fire-fighting job.  We started by filling up our beer cans with lake water and pouring it on the fire.  That wasn’t getting anywhere very fast.  James then had an epiphany to use our bilge pumps.  He would figure that out, being that he is a pipe-fitter and all!  Even though the pumps carried a lot more water, it still took quite a lot of trips, perhaps a dozen or more, to put out that seemingly “itsy bitsy” smoldering campfire. </p>

<p>Having done a good 10 kilometres in 2 hours, we were done kayaking for the day and had a whole bunch of day left.  The long weekend crowds that were predicted did not transpire.  There weren’t many people around to mingle with and there was no tube to watch, so we buried our noses in our books.  James was reading <i>Absolute Power</i> by James Baldacci.  I was reading James A. Michener’s story of the Gold Rush called, <i>Journey</i>, and it was really pulling me a long.  Even though I am a writer, I’m not a fast reader and I can get easily distracted if a story isn’t interesting enough for me.  When I read, it is usually one chapter at a time, or even a couple of pages at a time.  I wasn’t having that problem with <i>Journey</i>.  I was really enjoyably lost in it, getting through more than half the book in a day. </p>

<p>Even though <i>Journey</i> was a lot of fun, it had some “plot holes” that bothered me.  I think that Michener has not spent a lot of time in the wilderness, as he seems to have missed out some crucial details of wilderness living…mosquitoes for one!  He mentions them in one area in the Yukon, but they should have been everywhere. When I was working in fire towers in Lac La Biche (not far from Athabasca Landing, a major launching point of the Gold Rush), I had to wear a sufficient amount of armor to protect myself from them when I went for walks in the evening.  Not only did I wear clothing to cover every bit of bare skin and my head, I had to douse myself with copious amounts of mosquito repellent on my face and head and even over my clothes!  Even with that, sometimes I had to wear mosquito netting and that didn’t even work!  With all this protection, the mosquito problem was only less, not eliminated…reduced to bearable!  If not properly protected, a person in the bush could easily die from mosquito and bug bites alone. </p>

<p>Another thing that bothered me was the lack of animal encounters.  The main characters spent years in the wilderness getting to their Gold Rush.  You cannot spend that much time out in the wilderness without having a significant amount of interaction with animals, not just with larger creatures like bear and moose, but also smaller ones like squirrels, beavers, ground hogs, etc.  Not only that, but they would have had to listen to the wolves and the coyotes howling on many a night, and it would have a certain effect on them.  His description made the north seem more like a void with trees.  I tend to see the forest as a bustling city with animals in it, with every square inch of territory claimed by some kind of critter, big or small.  The forest is private property, but, instead of being marked with stakes and fence lines, it is marked with pee.  Perhaps animals back then made themselves more invisible because they were at a high risk of becoming someone’s lunch.  Nevertheless, I find his depiction of the north to be very one-dimensional, as if the north is simply a back drop for human activity, rather than a mystical and alive world onto itself. </p>

<p>This is why I think it is so unfortunate that First Nations communities had to suffer through the residential school system.  The residential schools dismembered centuries of knowledge that the First Nations people had about the “engine of life” that is the forest.  The fact that so much information has been lost in the cultural genocide might prove disadvantageous for all of us sometime in the future. </p>

<p>For example:  lately, I’ve been getting into ethno botany.  I’ve been educating myself about herbs and foods that grow locally that First Nations people harvested back in the day.  Now, when I walk past forest vegetation, I see it very differently than I used to.  In the fall, James and I joined family for a gathering at Rupert Arm.  As soon as I got there I couldn’t help but notice a bunch of red clover for my arthritis, rose hips for colds and sea asparagus for making sea asparagus pickles and I set about picking.  I’m sure everybody thought I was a little odd, but they got used to it.  What others might see as just vegetation, I now see as a grocery and health food store!  This is very ironic, as many of the Gold Rush trekkers in Michener’s book suffered from scurvy and died from it.  Little did these scurvy sufferers realize that they were surrounded with the cure: spruce and pine needles are loaded with vitamin C!  They could have made a tea from them or ate them straight.  This is what likely happened in real life too: Gold Rushers died from scurvy while being literally surrounded by the antidote!  Anyone in the gold rush era who attempted to forage a connection with First Nations people probably had a leg up, and were the ones who survived and thrived. </p>

<p>I was struck with a bit of nostalgia when the book mentioned my home town “Athabasca Landing” or just “Athabasca.”  I always knew it had a close association with the Gold Rush.  I was surprised to discover just how much!  I was amazed at how so many footsteps from afar went through the sleepy little community that I grew up in. </p>

<p>I was taken aback by the fact that Michener mentioned a passenger train between Calgary and Edmonton.  I had never heard such a thing, although many bemoan the fact that there isn’t one between the two major cities in the present day.  There’s been a lot of talk about a high speed raised rail line between Calgary and Edmonton when I was living there, but so far, nothing has happened.  You would think if any two cities need a train between them, it would be Edmonton and Calgary.  They are the two main cities in the province, are relatively the same size, and have a lot of flat ground between them.  I checked it out and it looks like there actually was a passenger train between Calgary and Edmonton during the Gold Rush.  It looks as if there were several attempts to maintain train service along that route afterward, which were curtailed by the First World War and then by the popularity of the airplane and automobile.  One would think that, with global warming and infrastructure development being prominent issues of the day, perhaps an elevated solar and/or wind powered high speed train service between Edmonton and Calgary might finally come into fruition? </p>

<p>We kept reading until it got dark, then we pulled out our flashlights and read some more.  After retiring to out tent, the books still didn’t get put away. As Chloe snored away under a pile of blankets at our feet, we kept on reading for over an hour more before finally calling it quits on our day long readathon. </p>

<p>On Sunday we headed north, crossing Alice Lake on a diagonal.  James kept     complaining I was racing too far ahead.  When I slowed down, it made way for plenty of conversation about life.  We kept paddling for the longest time, but our destination did not seem to get too close too fast.  We were dealing with a lot of water, apparently, a lot more than we thought!  Finally, when the distance between our boats and the distant shore was finally bridged, we came upon the first of the hidden treasures we would come upon that day: a huge graveyard of driftwood!  Along the whole shore, from the east side of the lake to the point, which was maybe a good kilometre, there was driftwood everywhere.  Some of it was massive!  I could have spent hours and hours enjoying all the smooth voluminous shapes with strange twisty roots that looked like fallen imaginary monsters.  I also had the urge to save some of these pieces to make lamps and end tables, but there was no room on the kayaks!  I supposed we could have towed, but I was more interested in kayaking on further.  Chloe was snooping in all the nooks and crannies that served as protection for small critters and their stashes.  A couple of times she walked along some driftwood and found herself up too high up to get down on the ground and we had to provide her with some assistance. </p>

<p>We discovered some of the driftwood was carved with chain saws.  I started putting two and two together and realized this would be a good place for fire-fighters to “day base.”  When the fire hazard gets up there, a helicopter full of fire fighters flies out to a spot in the bush so they can be closer to a sensitive area should a fire break out.  This was probably an ideal spot to hang out for the day for fire-fighters trying to cope with the boredom of day-basing, hence why some of them got out their power saws and started trying to make art, or something, out of the driftwood.  We went a little further and discovered this was a well used base.  My presumption proved correct when, deep in the driftwood, we found the bare bones of a camp kitchen, about twenty by twenty feet square, constructed out of stumps.  It had a roof with some roofing paper on top, and counters with plywood tops. </p>

<p>All we had for taking pictures of the driftwood was my flip phone.  It was too bad, because taking photos of sculptural objects, I’d say, is my specialty.  James had a Galaxy 3 for taking pictures, but, for some reason, those photos went missing.  For this Link River trip, all we have are flip phone photos.  Many apologies for the low resolution images.  That will change.  We later upgraded our picture taking equipment to a higher definition camera phone, and are now looking to upgrade even more with a water resistant SLR camera.  When we get it, I think we are going to have make a special trip out to Driftwood Beach to take pictures. </p>

<p>After a snack and some pictures among the stumps, we took off around the point, hoping to get close to the island to the north.  That also seemed to take a long time too, even though it looked like it was quite close at first.  As we rounded the island we noticed something odd on the rocky shore of the lake.  It was a log tied to a tree beside a fire pit.  Going around the rocky outcrop we saw a weatherworn dock.  I wanted to keep going but James was more curious.   Still feeling a little awkward in the kayak, I thought it would be hard to get into our kayaks from that dock.  I suggested to James to go ahead and check things out.  He came back saying “you’ve got to see this.”  We docked our kayaks, tying them to any lose rope we could find on the ramshackle pier. </p>

<p>I wondered what could have possibly got him so excited.  After I pulled myself up the steep narrow path through the Salal, there it was in all its rugged glory:  a cabin!  James told me he had heard of cabins like this interspersed through the bush.  They are built on crown land, so no one actually owns them even though they have had a lot of effort and expense put into building them.  This cabin was built with two by fours, plywood and cedar planks on a foundation of logs embedded into the ground.  It had a covered front porch and a leaning outhouse a ways away.  There was a sign on the door written in pencil, welcoming us in.  We were told we could make use of the cabin and the items inside, but to keep it cleaner than when we arrived and replace anything we used.  Inside there was a wood stove, a picnic table and lighting in the form of candles and kerosene lamps.  There were roughshod counters with Rubbermaid totes underneath.  One was filled with pots, pans, dishes and utensils, and another was filled with board games.  There was an old sofa from the seventies or eighties and a guest book that was filled to the brim with comments made by its visitors that went back as far as 1995.  It was quite possible that the people who originally built this cabin hadn’t seen it in a good long while.  There were two levels of beds built into the wall with a ladder for getting up to the higher one.  There was an emergency supply of toilet paper hanging from the middle of the ceiling on a rope, to be kept from being devoured by rats and mice. </p>

<p>James and I sat down and had our snack and read through some of the guest book.  Since it was at the end, we vowed that the next time we came, we’d bring a new one.  We wanted to stay there and spend the night, but I had lunch supervisor duty the next day.  We followed a trail down to the fire pit we saw from the water, imagining what it would be like to be sitting around a campfire under the stars.  We proclaimed it very lovely and definitely a future destination. </p>

<p>We didn’t have too much difficulty getting into our boats from the dock.  You just have to walk on your hands and slip your keister down.  We paddled around the island.  I got disoriented and James had to straighten me out and make me go in the right direction.  Thank God he stopped me or we might have ended up going down Marble River!  Going back, with the sun coming out, it made the water a very intense blue.  With the Merry Widow in the background another lovely hue of blue, we took numerous pictures of it with James’ phone which are now lost forever!  After spending so much time out-paddling James, at the last stretch going home, he out-paddled me.  He left me in the dust (or the splash), with my paddling getting continually weaker and weaker.  He got his second wind and my wind was out!  We estimated that we kayaked a total of 12 kilometres that day.  For the whole weekend I kayaked 25 kilometres and James did close to 30!  Not bad for first timers!</p>

<p>So an over-aged boy scout, a retired Smokey the Bear and a kayaking Chihuahua had their first official kayaking outing!  I’m surprised by how our little neighbourhood recreational retreat turned out to be such an adventure.  Stay tuned folks!  There will be many more adventures to come!</p>

	  <title>Welcome to Port Alice: A Kayaker’s Paradise</title>

	     <p>Hello, my name is Debra Lynn.  I live in Port Alice with my partner, James, two cats named Pepper and Mr. Magoo, and an adorable little Chihuahua named Chloe.  Port Alice is a village with a population of 500 situated at the northern end of Vancouver Island.   In one respect it is your average small remote BC town with bare bones amenities of a grocery store, a gas station, a convenience store, a campsite, a hotel, a Royal Canadian Legion, a library and a thrift store.  Not much happens, life moves slowly and everybody knows everybody.  Port Alice was a much larger town once upon a time -- with a population nearing 2000 -- in its heyday in the seventies when the mill was going strong.  Now the mill, almost a century old, is having trouble competing in the new millennium.  It went through a series of curtailments since the eighties and eventually declared bankruptcy in 2004.  Shortly after getting new owners in 2011, it went into a production curtailment with no real promise of getting back to full service anytime soon.  The town has emptied out, and those who are left have to work out of town, even out of province.  A lot of people are down in the dumps, missing the days when half the population had whopping big paycheques.  It’s as if the town has become “Nowheresville” to many of the residents.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post1-welcome/debnjames.jpg" alt="JamesandMe"><em>James and me</em></p>

<p>In another respect, Port Alice is a gem—a potential tourist hotspot like Banff or Jasper.  When you see the view driving into town, you can’t help but gasp as the beauty of it….even if you’ve lived here for a few years!  Nestled in a mountain side on the shores of the Neroutsos Inlet, practically every house in the village has a “million dollar view.”  Although there is the mill, it is 5 kms from town and very much out of sight.  Close to the east shore of the inlet is a grouping of islands called the Frigon Islands that remind me of those famous photos of Spirit Island on Maligne Lake in the Rocky Mountains.  It is not uncommon to have a bear or even a cougar walk through town.  An eagle flying overhead is an everyday occurrence.  If you go down to the water, chances are you will have a close encounter with some kind of aquatic life, whether it be birds, a seal, a sea lion, a sea otter, even an orca or a humpback whale!  Look into the water from the dock and watch schools of fish, crab, starfish and jellyfish going about their business.  If you happen to be into kayaking, call Port Alice paradise!   </p>

<p>Not only can residents like ourselves hop into our kayaks from the shore of the town for a paddle in majestic scenery and natural wonders, but the surrounding area holds a multitude of potential kayaking adventures.  You can take the logging roads to the Wild West Coast and visit pristine sights like Side Bay, Gooding Cove, Harvey Cove, Brooks Peninsula and Klaskino Inlet to name a few. Visitors and traffic to those areas are so infrequent and they look so untouched that, when you get there, you might feel like you discovered them!  Cradled in the mountains and a short drive from Port Alice are Alice Lake and Victoria Lake, with a well maintained campsite at Link River that joins the two bodies of water.  The Neroutsos Inlet is a south branching arm of the Quastsino Sound.  Looking at my map of the Quatsino Sound on my wall, I see enough coves, inlets and islands that would take many life times to explore!  At the end of the sound is the Quatsino Narrows leading into the Holberg Inlet.  A little larger than Neroutsos Inlet, it too has enormous potential for kayaking exploration.  On the Port Hardy side of the island there are places like Storey’s Beach for an easy paddle and God’s Pocket Provincial Marine Park for the more ambitious kayaker.  In the Port McNeill area are the Broughton and Johnstone Straits—popular areas for whale watching.  To the south of Port McNeill is a grouping of lakes, including Nimpkish Lake and Huson Lake with the Little Huson Lake Cave Regional Park.  These places are but a few examples where the possibilities for kayaking adventures are virtually endless!</p>

<p>I came to Port Alice in 2010, to get away from crowds and cities and focus on my writing.  I ended up buying a very cheap fixer-upper condominium, paying about a quarter of the price of a similar house in any other part of the country.   Even though the interior of the house was a seventies decore eye-sore, I was sold on the long balcony with an ocean and mountain view!   In 2013, I self-published my first children’s picture book, Marshmallow, and have started illustrating a second picture book.  I met my partner, James, in 2014 even though we had both been living here since 2010.  At a darts tournament at the Legion the gods were up to something, as we got paired up as a couples’ team from names drawn out of a hat.  We didn’t get into the finals, but I did win a turkey for highest women’s score and then we scored each other’s phone numbers and the rest is history.  Both James and I have always been quite active throughout our lives.  We both contemplated getting into kayaking at some point in the past but never got around to it.  Although I’ve worked as a forest fire lookout for 18 years and am pretty brazen about trudging through the bush by myself, being that I was a “prairie chicken” (ie. from Alberta), I didn’t think I had enough “ocean instincts” to kayak on my own.  Not long after meeting each other, we plunked down some money for a couple of second-hand kayaks and started paddling like we knew what we were doing.  </p>

<p>When I met James I didn’t just get one kayaking partner, I got two!  He insisted his little Chihuahua, Chloe, had to come with us.  We even bought a tandem kayak with a special seat for her!  When I was first introduced to Chloe, with her big eyes and big pointy ears, I gave her the nick-name “Ferbie.”  I have to admit, though I am an avid dog lover, I wasn’t crazy about Chihuahuas.  When I was a kid, my cousins had a Chihuahua that wasn’t very friendly.  Plus, Chloe didn’t have a lot of fur and had funny big ears and a little curled up nose that made her look like a bat.  It wasn’t long, though, before she became the cutest dog in the world to me!  She is not so much a dog, but more like a human child.  She can sit in our laps and be carried around like a baby.  She is hungry for attention, is prone to jealousy, hides behind us whenever she is scared and is psychically tuned to our moods.  Since James and I are past the age for having babies, Chloe has become our baby.  Some words in English she knows very well are “walk” and, especially, “car ride,”  and lately, “kayak” to which she responds by pointing her ears up like a couple of antennae and tilting her head inquisitively.  When she isn’t walking, car riding or kayaking, she likes to curl up inside a blanket and sleep.  She is very skilled at lifting a blanket with her nose, crawling under it and then turning around inside it, making a little mushroom cap shaped tent for herself.  Because she has short hair and a Mexican heritage, she is always trying to stay warm.  For some reason, she barks whenever the cats try to claw the furniture (even though she has never been trained to do so), earning her the title of “furniture police.”  She gets a long fine with the cats and the cats get along fine with her, but only to a point.  She has her “personal space.”  If the cats get too close, she gives them a little growl.  Once Chloe and Mr. Magoo got too close to each other when I was in the kitchen and it produced the strangest combination cat/Chihuahua noise I ever heard!  Once Pepper tried to lie across Chloe, but Chloe let her know in no uncertain terms that she was not a cat bed!  Lately, however, I’ve noticed Chloe allowing the cats get close enough to her so that they are almost snuggling.  Although she is smaller than one of our cats, Chloe thinks she is a guard dog.  The pint sized pooch barks at anyone who walks by with real guard dog authority, making the perceived intruders laugh hysterically.  </p>

<p>So we are fifty-something new kayakers with a Chihuahua set out to explore our incredibly beautiful back yard.  Since writing is my thing, I thought I’d share our experiences with you, perhaps giving you some ideas for your own out-of-the-way vacation adventures.  Although tourism is not without an environmental impact, I believe that getting to know all these beautiful nooks and crannies that exist in nature can teach us more respect and reverence for Mother Earth, and make us more inclined to take better care of her.  Although the real solutions for our environmental problems await us sometime in the future, we need to become familiar with and appreciate the beautiful spiritual domains that exist outside our city limits to get the process started.  </p>

<p>I think there are more tourist gems in our country than the general population is aware of.  I was a world traveler in my younger days, traveling to China, Japan, Mexico, the US and Europe.  I’ve met countless people from these crowded polluted countries who dream of experiencing the serenity and ruggedness of places like Canada.  Never mind oil and gas.  I think the millions of square kilometres of our relatively untouched nature are our most viable economic resource.   </p>

<p>The entries into this blog of our 2015 kayaking trips will be entered in belatedly.  I kept notes of our kayaking, but we faced a bit of a learning curve when it came to making a blog.  After some research, and help form my computer programmer son, we got it figured out.  Once we get caught up and submit all of our 2015 stories, we hope to add future entires shortly after each of our expeditions.  </p>
