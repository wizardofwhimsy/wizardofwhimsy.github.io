	     <p><b>July 30, 2017</b></p>

<p>Side Bay, the fantastic bay with the oddly innocuous name, is Port Alice’s best kept secret. Since I’ve lived in Port Alice, I’ve listened to people talk about Side Bay like it was some kind of precious gem or a magical haven. This really means something in a place like Vancouver Island that has stunning views just about everywhere you look! </p>

<p>Before going to Side Bay, I talked to my cat sitter, Leah, about it. She enthusiastically told me that I’m going to love it. I asked her what is so special about it. She mused and then, struggling for an answer, said that it is “like Hawaii.” </p>

<p>Well, yes, I guess it is a lot like Hawaii. It is a large bay with islands and black lava rock protrusions with the background sound of a gentle surf hitting the beach. It just has pine and fir trees instead of palm trees. It also does have an air of a warmer place, which, I realized, might be because it is right beside Brooks Bay Peninsula. Brooks Bay Peninsula was just missed by the big ice cap in the last ice age and still has vegetation from another era. I think some seeds might have blown over to Side Bay. I did notice some odd-looking plants there. While preparing this post I realized that it has the most photos of all other of my posts. This goes to show you that Side Bay has plenty of “visual interest.”</p>

<p>James bought a new truck, a four-wheel drive, just in time for our trip to Vancouver Island. We also had a new fancy dancy kayak carrier, a new kitchen centre and a couple of camping chairs with their own little table on the side and cup holder. We were stylin’ kayakers!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post16-sidebay/stylin.jpg" alt="Side Bay"></p>

<p>Since we had taken this road to the Wild West Coast before, we thought that we knew where we were going. Once we got into the belly of the forest, uncertainty set in. We relived our fear of taking the wrong turn and getting lost or ending up on top of a mountain cut-block with no room to turn around. We scrambled around the truck for our <i>BC Coast Explorer</i> and the <i>Backwoods Map Book</i>, trying to figure out this route like it was the first time we’d taken it. We bemoaned that I did not bring a printed out copy of my post for Gooding Cove of 2016, that I laboriously edited and re-edited, to use as a guide. There is such a labyrinth of logging roads in the area, it is just too easy to get lost. </p>

<p>Things were a little easier this time though, as, with Port Alice’s new tourism promotion initiative, we found nice new professionally done guide signs that replaced the home-made ones from the year before. In keeping with the tendency of BC backwoods signage, however, there weren’t many signs at the beginning of the route. </p>

<p>To get to Side Bay, take Marine Drive from Port Alice around the inlet. Follow it until it “becomes” Teeta Main (there’s no turn or dividing marker)—it is just Marine Drive in one part, and Teeta Main the next part. When you get to that hairpin turn 25 km from Port Alice, there is no guess work at all. There is a lovely sign pointing the way to Teeta 500 (or K 500) and other mains that come after. After Teeta 500, you take K main, then I main. Somewhere around I main, the signage for Side Bay and Gooding Cove starts, and that’s all you need to know. </p>

<p>May I once again remind you to avoid travelling on the logging roads between 6 am and 6 pm on the weekdays when the loggers are at work. In a lot of places, the roads are very narrow and only allow passage for one vehicle. This means if you come face to face with a logging truck you could be toast! They will stop if they can, but sometimes they can’t because of their heavy loads and could plough right into you! If this happens, they are not liable either. If you do come up on a logging truck that can’t stop for you, head straight for the ditch or the bush. </p>

<p>There is another complication to this scenario. Though most loggers maintain banker’s hours, some contract-based logging companies don’t always—so you must always be wary. I talked to someone in the forestry industry and he says that that’s quite rare for the North Island. It tends to happen more on the Central Island. To travel the backwoods of Vancouver Island you need to have a thick skin…but a lot of people do it. In my post for Gooding Cove, I wrote about how James and I came across a logging truck and survived. It appeared the truck was expecting us. A Western Forest Products pick-up had driven by earlier and they likely informed the logging truck via the 2-way radio that there were a couple of yahoos with kayaks on the road. </p>

<p>Also, when you venture into the back country, make sure to tell someone where you’re going and when you plan to be back, so it doesn’t take days or weeks before someone realizes you’re missing. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the trip to Side Bay only took two hours. When we went to Gooding Cove last year—because we got side-tracked to Cayeuse Main and had to back track, and then ended up stuck on a mountain top (with a stunning view of Quatsino Sound)—the same journey took us 5 hours! </p>

<p>Arriving at Side Bay, we spent a few moments in stunned silence taking in the scene before us. There were people around, but the vastness and the beauty of the huge bay made them seem quite insignificant. </p>

<h2>Side Bay Beach</h2>

<p>We set up camp right away and headed out onto the water. There was a good surf hitting the beach, but the water in the middle of the bay looked <i>flatish</i>. After struggling to figure out a way to get on the water without getting Chloe and ourselves all wet, we decided to go in nose first. It worked! </p>

<p>Once we were on the water, we discovered that we were riding some pretty big rollers. The water wasn’t “flatish” at all! It felt a little like being on an elevator going up and down without stopping. If this were my first time on a kayak, I would have been having a serious panic attack!</p>

<p>We paddled by the rocky north shore, trying to take pictures while also saying “wee wee” as we went up and down the ocean roller coaster. We ended up at Mayday Island, on the sandy beach at the northeast corner, to have our snack. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post16-sidebay/riding_swells.jpg" alt="Side Bay"></p>

<p><b>July 31, 2017</b></p>

<p>That first sojourn we thought we had seen all there was to see and wondered what we’d have to explore the next couple of days. As it turns out, there would be a lot to discover just by checking out all the nooks and crannies of the bay. </p>

<p>The next day, we planned to get up “bright and early” so we could maybe kayak out to Lawn point, a stretch of land that looks to be covered by a primed lawn from the air, which is actually very tall grasses hiding rough boulders. We were even fantasizing about going on to Restless Bite by passing the turbulent Kwaikiutl Point.</p>

<p>We had the best intentions. Even though we did get up fairly early, by the time we got cleaned and fed and had our coffee, we didn’t get onto the water until around noon. It turned out to be a good thing. The water wasn’t as turbulent as the day before. The rollers on the bay were much smaller than yesterday, but, as we headed toward the open ocean, they became enormous! </p>

<p>James said we could turn back if I wanted to. I paddled ahead a little more, then accepted the offer. We later realized we should only be out here with skirts and not with a Chihuahua. We realized, once our kayaks filled with water out there, our gooses would be quite cooked! We saw a few kayakers paddle out to that area, but they were likely not kayaking with a Chihuahua and probably had skirts, tons of experience and plenty of bravado!</p>

<p>The situation then got a little more interesting. After deciding to head to the far east side of the bay (the other end of the bay from our campsite) the wind picked up. The ride got rough and rocky. We kept getting splashed. We realized, if this wind had suddenly come along on the open ocean, it would not have been fun to say the least! If we had gone out there in the morning when the water was calmer, we might have gone too far afield, possibly even going on a hike. When it would have been time to go back—after a little daytime heating—we probably would have had to fight the winds and maybe even a few breakers on the open ocean. </p>

<p>Hitting that wind, we made a sharp left turn and headed in the direction of our campsite. This is where I came to understand the term “crosswinds.” The waves were going from west to east, and the wind was coming from the north to south. The smooth undulating waves developed choppy points that knocked us all over the place!</p>

<p>Having cut our kayaking trip short, we were quite disappointed. Nevertheless, we took our kayaking snack at the far west end of the beach in the shade of the stones. We checked out a huge cave from afar that was only visible at low tide. We did some sunbathing and even some swimming. James went in the icy cold water (in this way, Side Bay is not like Hawaii!). As usual, James was the braver one, swimming a lap or two. I got wet up to my waist and dunked my hair in the water. Later I noticed that my hair was quite soft and silky, which probably explains why so many products from the sea are used in personal care products.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post16-sidebay/cave_visible.jpg" alt="Side Bay"></p>

<p>As evening approached, we went out for a short kayak ride to explore the shore just north of the beach. We saw a driftwood beach, then came upon a wall of stones. At that moment the wind seriously picked up again and I wanted to go back, but Mr. Adventure just went around the stones. It was a good thing too. What we discovered was a photographer’s delight!</p>

<p>On the other side of the wall of stones we found volumetric shadows, high contrasts with blue and black and water making interesting patterns pouring through crevices. I call this place the “Side Bay Stonehenge.” I took too many pictures, and it was a lucky thing too. I still had a lot to learn about photographing shadows using metering. If I focused on the rocks, the camera would overexpose them and take away the strong shadows. I had to focus the metering on the water to make the rocks looks like the dark and powerful monoliths that they were. </p>

<p><b>August 1, 2017</b></p>

<p>For day three, we were out of ideas; but still ended up having an adventure anyway. The winds from the north were fierce. We “settled” for a return to Mayday Island. Since we were passing by the north side of the island. I saw a monolith of a rock that would have made a good picture, so I decided to turn the kayak around and get a shot. As I was doing this, James, ahead of me and already around the island, noticed I was nowhere to be seen! </p>

<p>After I took my shot, I had to fight with all my might to turn back around in the wind and waves and follow the course. James wasn’t too happy about my risking life and limb for art. He gave me quite a scolding when he finally found me. The whole thing was kind of for naught anyway, as the photo wasn’t very sharp or well-framed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post16-sidebay/risky.jpg" alt="Side Bay"></p>

<p>Landing at Mayday Island for a break, the creativity gods compensated me for not getting a good shot of the monolith. As I came sliding onto the beach, I saw these little seaweed plants twisting and turning in the clear water. With the added enhancement of ripples, the seaweed struck me as expressionistic art. I took a gazillion pictures! Here are just a few of them. </p>

<h2>Seaweed Art</h2>

<p>We originally wanted to paddle up the creek just east of the island, but it had to be ruled out because of the low tide. It probably could have been an interesting adventure. Paddling around the east side of Mayday Island, we found a beautiful hidden beach for some all-over sun tanning, skinny dipping and rock picture taking. It had a smooth sandy white beach surrounded by black lava boulders and a view of black lava islands in the distance. It felt like it was just us and the Pacific Ocean! The water was great for swimming: it was nice and shallow with clear water revealing a sandy bottom. I spent more time in the water than James this time. It took me a while and a few dunks to get adapted to the icy water, but I even swam around a bit. </p>

<h2>Secluded Beach</h2>

<p>When we got back, we were treated to a ride up the mountain in quads by a couple of our camping neighbours. They took us up to a lookout point where we were able to get some great aerial shots of the Rugged Islands and Brooks Bay Peninsula. The sky was tinged with a little bit of brown—a sign of the many forest fires raging that summer—that turned the whole scene a dusty pink as the sun went down. </p>

<h2>Lookout Point</h2>

<p>Our guides, who had been camping at Side Bay every summer for years and years, acted like they were showing us around their personal back yard. They told us stories of people they had met here. They told us about a Japanese lady who came straight from Japan, with no previous kayaking experience. She landed in Canada, bought a kayak and proceeded to kayak around Vancouver Island all alone with no radio and apparently very little food. She had even somehow managed to paddle around the potentially violent waters of Cape Scott and survive! When I was talking to one of the fishermen at the marina in Port Alice once, he told me that a buoy that was located at Cape Scott once recorded waves 100 feet high before it disconnected and went out of commission! It was quite possible the waves got even higher after that! </p>

<p>When the Japanese lady showed up at Side Bay, with only a bag of rice left in her kayak, the campers fed her a nice big meal. They gave her a lure and taught her how to use it so she could feed on fish. She took off the next day before everyone was up, leaving the lure behind. The next hurdle on her destination was the tip of Brooks Bay Peninsula, which can be almost as bad as Cape Scott. Not far past the tip, the ocean floor takes an abrupt and steep drop, which can make for some wicked turbulence. We all wondered if she survived. Even so, it’s amazing how far she managed to get on her romantic, poorly informed ideas about kayaking in Canada. </p>

<p>The couple also told us the historical story about a plane carrying payroll cash that crashed at Lawn Point. We were told two guys had survived the crash; one was severely injured. The more able-bodied person decided he would hike out to get help. Oddly, he also decided he should take the payroll money with him. The guy who was left had died and the guy who hiked out was never found. He might have been attacked by wild animals, but the cynic in me contemplated that with all that money, he might have seen fit to hitch or hijack a ride on a boat and leave the country. </p>

<p>I looked into the story a little more at home. It was a US Navy plane with six crew members that didn’t return from a navigation exercise in 1943. The plane did indeed have payroll on it. While searching for the Port Hardy Air Force Base, the pilot saw a break in the clouds and what looked like a carefully manicured lawn. It was the tall grasses hiding the abundance of rocks of Lawn Point! When the wreckage was found in 1944, with a rudimentary camp and the remains of five men, one man and one payroll, as well as watches, guns and other valuables were missing. </p>

<p>After telling their tales, our guides then asked me about my blog that I had mentioned a couple of times before. As soon as I told them the title of this entry will be “Side Bay, Port Alice’s Best Kept Secret” I gulped, wishing I could take my words back. Their expressions suddenly changed. Their chattiness ended abruptly. They quickly took us back down the mountain and gave us the cold shoulder for the remainder the weekend. They had been keeping Side Bay as their personal private getaway and didn’t want the outside world to know about it! </p>

<p>As I was looking at the map of Side Bay while writing up this post, I realized that Klaskino Inlet is very accessible from there. To get there by road you have to go over a rough mountain road, which, until not long ago, was impassable. I recently ran into some very experienced kayakers who made it there by the overland route. I had taken their number for writing an article about them for the North Island Gazette, but ended up losing it when my One Note app malfunctioned. They said it was passable because of some active logging going at the time, but who knows if it still is? I have long thought of Klaskino Inlet as a possible “Kayakers’ Shangri la.” It cuts into the mountains for quite a distance so it should have a very “canyon-like” and remote feel to it. From Side Bay it would probably amount to a two-day excursion there and back going at a steady pace. </p>

<p>John Kimantas talks a bit about it in his <i>BC Coast Explorer </i>. There was a lot of active logging going on there at the time, so it sounded like an industrial zone. It might have reverted to it’s more or less natural state by now. He also mentions that there are not a lot of good places to launch. Anchorage Island might be a good place to set up camp for the night—if it’s anything like Mayday Island—but don’t quote me on that. It could very well be nothing but rocks and trees right up to the water! There must be some beaches to land on around it where the waves from the open ocean hit and smooth out the shoreline into nice sandy beaches. It’s something worth checking out for the adventurous. </p>

	     <p>As the mill in Port Alice closed down and people moved away for work, James and I eventually ended up joining the exodus in September of 2016. He went to a mill maintenance shut down in Mackenzie, then was offered a job there. I kept my place in Port Alice and we planned to come back for holidays to kayak and continue the blog. In the summer of 2017, I came back to Port Alice earlier with Chloe and the cats to do some work on my house. When James arrived for his two-week holiday, we crammed in three monumental (and as it turned out) life-altering kayaking trips into those two weeks.</p>

<p>Mackenzie is way up in northern BC, a couple of hours past Prince George. Like Port Alice, Mackenzie is a pulp mill town that has had its ups and downs. The mill closed for a while, then reopened again. Before I bought my place in Port Alice, I was actually looking at some dirt-cheap houses in Mackenzie during the time that the mill was closed.</p>

<p>Mackenzie reminded me very much of my hometown, Athabasca, in Alberta, except it has a lot more snow! Athabasca is quite dry for the most part. It can be cold, but there is usually only foot or two of snow most years. Mackenzie is at roughly the same latitude, but the town is nestled in mountains—so there is <i>incredible amount</i> of snow! Sometimes it gets so bad that people have to shovel the snow off their roofs to keep them from caving in. A fond (or not-so-fond) memory I have of Mackenzie is looking out into our back yard in the middle of winter and seeing our patio furniture almost buried.</p>

<p>We took quite a few kayak trips around Mackenzie in the spring, to Morfee Lake, Tudya Lake, Azouzetta Lake and Dina Lakes. Morfee Lake is right in the municipality of Mackenzie. You can’t see any trace of the town when you’re there, so it feels like you are deep in the wilderness. Tudya Lake is a quiet and quite secluded-feeling lake 25 minutes south of Mackenzie, just off of highway 97. Azouzetta Lake is nestled in the mountains near the famous Powder King ski resort on the road to Dawson Creek. Dina Lakes was unique. Near the sprawling Williston Lake, it is a cluster of lakes with portage routes of varying lengths. We took a shorter portage and ended up encountering a moose and a brown bear quite close up. The north certainly merits its own blog, but I will only include a few photos for the sake of comparison. One thing about kayaking in the north—though we saw some beautiful pristine sites—there was something about the lack of tides that was disappointing. I guess the changing tides add an extra element of challenge and adventure to a kayaking trip.</p>

<p><b>July 23, 2017</b></p>

<p>Back on Vancouver Island, we ended up going to Schoen Lake as an afterthought. Our big plans were for Side Bay this trip but, when we arrived in Port Alice, we needed to do some kayaking right away. Schoen Lake seemed to be the only thing we could fit into that time slot. James lived in Campbell River most of his life and hadn’t seen it before, though he knew people who had. He assumed that it was just another overrun public campsite, but it would be a good excuse to get paddling. It turned out to be more than an excuse. It didn’t feel “public” at all. It was more like a remote spiritual retreat. </p>

<p>To get there we turned west off Highway 19 and followed the Mt. Cain road. There are signs at both sides of the turnoff for Schoen Lake and Mt. Cain, plus one at the turnoff. It’s hard to miss. There are probably a couple of branches you can take before the main turnoff that could get you on the same track. We took one of those branches, but still saw lots of signage that lead us to the road to Schoen Lake. Once you get past a certain point, there is really only one road so it’s hard to get lost. It’s not a place with an endless maze of logging roads like it is on the way to Gooding Cove and Side Bay.</p>

<p>The road is still for die-hards. If you take an 80-foot camper on that road it’ll probably end up in a thousand little pieces by the end! Chloe wasn’t too pleased about the rough, bumpy ride. She kept giving James and me that “can you make it stop” look. It was only a 14 km route: but being so rough and tightly encased with trees, we had that “going to the ends of the Earth” feeling again. When we were beginning to doubt there actually was a campsite at the end of it, we finally saw the park sign and several campers. In fact, the sites were nearly full. We still managed to get a lovely one close to the water.</p>

<p>Schoen Lake is surrounded by mountains that encase it like tall cathedral walls. The mountains were so big and close, I could barely fit them into the frame of my camera. Unfortunately, inexperienced with my new recently acquired digital camera and equipment, I did not realize that I had a wide-angle lens in my camera pouch that could have captured everything in a single frame. It wouldn’t have captured the closed in feeling though. </p>

<p>As we paddled the evening of our arrival, we kept hearing waterfalls. James had to get off the kayak and go into the forest looking for the source of the sound. He found only a couple of small cascades. He kept feeling that if he would only go in a little farther, he would find a REALLY BIG waterfall…which probably would have been the case…maybe halfway up the mountain! The next day we would discover that Schoen Lake has many waterfalls! </p>

<p>We made it past the point where the lake bends when we were hit by a blast of wind. We wanted to go to the end of the lake, but, being that the sun would be setting soon and we were tired, we decided to save our energy for the next day.</p>

<p><b>July 24, 2017</b></p>

<p>We started out early in bright sunshine. We were grateful the wind was at our backs, but knew we’d pay for it later. On the way to the end of the lake, the many waterfalls produced a pleasant background noise. We couldn’t see half as many as we could hear.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/post15-schoenlake/watching_waterfalls.jpg" alt="Schoen Lake"><em>Watching waterfalls</em></p>

<p>The real waterfall bonus came when we reached the end of the lake and looked up to the ice fields on top of Mt. Schoen with its series of very high up branching waterfalls. It was stunning from far away, so it had to be magnificent up close! If I didn’t have such bad knees, we could have hiked up there. </p>

<p>When we landed at the end of the lake, we found ourselves in a dark, spirited old growth forest. I went around snapping the better part of my standard minimum 400 shots for a daily kayak outing. A lot of them ended up overexposed because I didn’t know how to adjust my camera for dark places. I did manage to get a few that captured the magic of the forest. </p>

<p>We followed a trail going in the opposite direction of the ice fields, on the hunt for waterfalls. By trail I don’t mean a wide path with lots of signage, I mean a wormy little skinny trail half hidden by shrubs and marked by tiny and very short strips of florescent tape. It only went so far, but it did at least bring us to a small waterfall. James, always wanting to explore, climbed behind it to investigate. I sat on the rocks, enjoying the waterfall and practicing getting the flowing water effect with my camera. It wasn’t hard, being that the light was so limited. It gave me no option but to use the required slower shutter speed. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post15-schoenlake/flowing_waterfall.jpg" alt="Schoen Lake"><em>Waterfall with flowing water effect</em></p>

<p>When we walked back to the boats, James checked out the trail up the mountain that went toward the ice field waterfalls. He thought it would lead to a plateau where one can get a better view. James seemed to have nominated himself caretaker of the waterfall route, clearing some of it and making big plans to return some day to complete the trail. </p>

<p>James was gone for a while, leaving Chloe and me to wonder and wait for him in the dark and spooky forest. Finally, I called for him and he came back shortly after. Before getting on the boats, we went toward the creek and perused an elk graveyard. </p>

<p>We paddled as far as the bend in the middle of the lake, then stopped for a snack. It was also time to give Chloe a dunking to cool her off. I took photos of wildflowers. We walked to the creek and finished the remainder of our snack by the bubbling rocky stream reflecting little stars of evening sunlight. </p>

<p>On the final leg of the journey, I must have been fighting a flu bug. I suddenly lost all the energy in my arms! I moved very slowly, making the paddle move from sheer willpower rather than strength. I was amazed I could get anywhere at all, especially going against the wind. As arduous as it was, we were sad when it was over.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post15-schoenlake/kayakers.jpg" alt="Schoen Lake"><em>I do hope these kayakers know what they are doing!</em></p>

<p>We ended up going back on the water at dusk. We paddled around near the campsite; then, floating side by side on our kayaks, we gazed at the gradually fading twilight pastel hues on Mt. Schoen. </p>

	     <p><i>I’d like to give a special thanks to three people for helping me with this post: Gwen Hansen of the Quatsino Museum and Archives for providing historical information on Ed Frigon; Jane Hutton of the Port Hardy Museum and Archives for allowing me to photograph images of Ed Frigon and his hotel; and, my friend and friendly neighbour, Evelyn Hartford, for providing me with a  photograph of Frigon’s hotel, articles and for being a general all round valuable resource for historical information on the North Island.</i></p>

<p><b>July 19, 2016</b></p>

<p>We wanted to go out on Neroutsos Inlet to Drake Island where the notorious Ed Frigon had his hotel and trading post between 1895 and 1917. We had been talking about the idea for a while. It took some convincing to get James on side for it: he thought our kayaks wouldn’t be big enough to carry all the stuff we needed. We finally concluded it shouldn’t be that hard, since many have paddled all the way around the Island with just their kayaks for carrying supplies…for a good stretch anyway. As it turned out, after paring down a few items, there was plenty of room for what we needed. Sea kayaks are big kayaks.  </p>

<p>Ed Frigon is one of Port Alice’s favourite historical “characters.” The very picturesque islands on Neroutsos Inlet are named after him. Frigon was an entrepreneur, an adventurer and a man with a mind of his own. He also had several wives, though not all at the same time. </p>

<p>Ed or “Ned” Frigon was born in Maurice, Quebec. At the age of 21 he left his family to find riches in the California Gold Rush of 1848-55. He took a boat to Panama, then crossed the isthmus by foot through mud, swamps, tropical heat by day and swarms of mosquitos by night. Making it to the Pacific coast in a little over a week, he took passage on a schooner to San Francisco. Although he managed to find gold, it was never enough to overcome the overinflated living costs in the area. He left the mines in disgust. He worked for a time in the San Francisco Bay area; then, not happy with the warm climate, he headed further up the coast. He eventually landed in Victoria, BC. In 1857, after accumulating a tidy savings, he headed to Hope Island on the north end of Vancouver Island to be a fur-trader.</p>

<p>Frigon was one of the first few white men to live among the local Indigenous population. He appeared to get along well with them; but, from time to time, a few “cultural disparities” would emerge. </p>

<p>The material goods in his store could incite envy in people who knew nothing but living off the land. A small group of unscrupulous men once plotted to kill him and divide his goods among themselves. Forewarned by his Indigenous wife at the time, the night of the planned attack he locked all the doors and windows and slept with several loaded weapons by his bed. It turned out that the locked door was enough to thwart the plan. </p>

<p>The next day Frigon opened his store and behaved as if nothing had happened, but had a message sent to the authorities in Victoria. A few weeks later a gunboat appeared, heading in the direction of Hope Island. Upon landing, the commander of the vessel warned the First Nations community that they would be punished should anything ever happen to Ed Frigon. After seeing many Indigenous communities decimated by the colonists, they considered this a serious threat. Thereafter, Frigon was accompanied by an entourage of Indigenous bodyguards wherever he went, to the point it became a serious encumbrance to him. </p>

<p>Of Ed Frigon’s many wives, most of them were Indigenous. He outlived some, was deserted by others and had to send at least one back to her people. Although Frigon was believed to be monogamous, he had a certain charm with women. One of his wives, who was the jealous type, tried to stab him with a butcher knife while he was in his bed. As she raised the knife to deliver the fatal blow, Frigon grabbed her wrist and said, “Not tonight Marie!” He removed the knife from her hand and threw her out of the house. It was with some regret, as he thought she was a very good housekeeper and “une dame belle.” </p>

<p>Frigon carried on trading on Hope Island until 1889, then built a second trading post at Korprino Harbour. In 1895 he moved to Quiet Cove, (Pamphlet Cove) on Limestone Island (now Drake Island) where he built a store, hospital, steamship stop and hotel with a saloon that had the ‘longest bar north of San Francisco.’ When rumours of prohibition were about, Frigon sold his hotel to the mill in 1917. He retreated to a large property north of Port Alice to live with his last common law wife, Lucy Moon. Lucy Moon had the title of “The Last of the Long Heads”: she was the last member of a group of Indigenous people who bound the heads of their children to elongate them. The hotel was floated down to Port Alice where it became a boarding house for mill workers, called “Jones’ Hotel.” </p>

<p>To get to Drake Island we ended up launching from Atkin’s Cove, a place we had been to before. To get there you take Neroutsos Main north of Port Alice on the east side of Neroutsos Inlet. Keep going on Neroutsos Main for 12 kilometres. Make sure to keep a careful eye on your odometer—it might be the only way you’ll be able to find the proper turn. About halfway there you will see a fork in the road with a branch that goes up the mountain. Don’t take it. That’s Quarry Main. It won’t take you to Atkin’s Cove, but it will take you up the mountain for an incredible view! Go up too far and you will definitely be needing a four-wheel drive and a strong stomach for driving on high mountain roads! Once you pass a side road on Nertoutsos Main with a wire across it, go a few metres further and turn left along a little “goat trail” that’s just wide enough for a vehicle to pass. Sometimes it is overgrown with shrubs, but sometimes it’s brushed. Drive for about a half a kilometre to a pull-out where you can park. In total, you shouldn’t go over 13 km from Port Alice. Any more than that and you’re lost! Let me remind you that if you go out into the bush, make sure to inform someone where you’re going and when you plan to be back so you don’t have to wait for days or even weeks before someone realizes you are missing. </p>

<p>If you look hard enough, on the south west side of the pull-out, you will see an opening in the shrubs which should be marked with florescent ribbon. That is the trail head. If you walk into the woods to the west, you will start to see water. If you read about our first adventure to Atkin’s Cove from years back, you will see how we got terribly lost! Check out my post, “Atkin’s Cove: Lost and Lost Again!” and have a laugh!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14-drakeisland/Entrance%20to%20the%20trail%20to%20Atkin&#x27;s%20Cove.JPG" alt="Drake-Island"><em>Entrance to the trail to Atkin’s Cove</em></p>

<p>James and I were originally going to launch at Kokwina Cove (which is a little portage to the east of the goat trail) that is at the edge of the Quatsino Narrows with all its nasty currents. We were going to time the tides to go out just before slack tide. I was apprehensive about the idea but didn’t say anything. Then, out of the blue, James voiced misgivings. I told him that if he’s uncertain, then I’m scared you-know-what-less! We talked about it some more, then concluded there were too many unknowns. We decided to take Atkin’s Cove to Drake Island instead. I said I would be willing to try Kokwina some day, but not with Chloe.</p>

<p>You could also get to Drake Island by launching from Port Alice, but it would be a minimum two-day trip. If you are a strong paddler, you may be able to make it to Drake Island in one day. If not, you could spend the night at Atkin’s Cove. Make sure to time the tides, so they are carrying you in the direction you want to go. Leave early in the morning before daytime heating makes the water on Neroutsos Inlet too choppy. </p>

<p>We dragged our supplies and kayaks down the hill to our launch point. Chloe was excited about getting into a kayak. As soon as I put a couple of blankets in her cockpit, she hopped in and wouldn’t leave!</p>

<p>The camera box only fits comfortably in the tandem Manitou; but, because I was due for surgery and James is so noble, he felt he had to paddle the heavier loaded down kayak. It ended up that I only had James’ phone—that doesn’t have a neck strap—for taking photos. I didn’t have much trouble paddling the larger kayak, but he insisted. It would turn out to be something he would woefully regret!</p>

<p>After leaving the tranquil calm waters of the cove, we met the rougher waters of Neroutsos Inlet—which were especially rough around the point! We made it around somehow, riding waves that made our kayaks feel like bucking broncos! </p>

<p>As soon as we came around the point to calmer waters, we met a community of Harbour seals—one with a baby—playing peek-a-boo with us. </p>

<p>When we crossed the inlet to the east side of Drake Island, our stomachs started complaining. It was 3 o’clock and we had only had breakfast. We landed briefly for a snack. Although we were on Drake Island, we still had a considerable paddle to get to Pamphlet Cove. As we paddled around the large island, we were getting impatient. We kept saying, “are we there yet?” It took a while, but we finally got there!</p>

<p>Coming up on the entrance of Pamphlet Cove, we entered a serene, windless, warmer, almost stagnant zone of the Sound. The water was calm, with bits of flotsam and foam floating on top. At the entrance of the cove were a couple of rock protrusions with bonsai-like trees on top. It made me think of a water-bound Japanese garden. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14-drakeisland/Me%20with%20bonsai-like%20trees.JPG" alt="Drake-Island"><em>Me with bonsai-like tree</em></p>

<p>We came across a sign surrounded by foxgloves. It informed us that the foxgloves marked the location of Ed Frigon’s hotel! That was the only sign of the previous human habitation, as the area had been almost completely reclaimed by the forest. </p>

<p>Before landing, we decided to explore the cove in our kayaks. The tide was ebbing out, but there was still enough water left for us to go in quite far. We saw lots of little fish. The cove is apparently a haven from the big fish of the sound. All the racing and roaring of the ocean was blocked out. Our voices and splashes echoed against the trees. James was well ahead of me, looking around and lost in wonderment. Unfortunately, that wonderment would be short-lived…</p>

<p>As I passed the shallow channel between the two sections of the hourglass shaped cove, I found a beautiful arrangement of three large starfish sitting together on some large rocks just below the surface of the rushing water. I snapped pictures like crazy! I was obsessed! I don’t know what it is with me a starfish, but they make me go bonkers! I envisioned making some serious money from the shot! </p>

<p>The current was strong and made it hard to stay still long enough to snap the photos. I kept putting James’ cell phone on my lap as I paddled frenetically. I took tons of pictures but kept wanting that one extra picture! When I started to put the camera away after that last extra, <i>extra</i> shot, as I transferred it from one hand to another, it did a sudden flip—as if someone or something had tried to reach out and grab it—then, plop!, into the water it went! </p>

<p>I screamed! I almost went in headfirst trying to reach for it. I tried to stay at the spot where it fell, so maybe we could somehow find it. I kept calling for James, but he wasn’t coming. I called again a couple of times. He finally showed up.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he asked. 
I told him I dropped his phone in the water. 
He said, “you’re joking, right?” 
I shook my head in the negative. 
Again, he said, “You are joking?” 
I shook my head again. </p>

<p>We repeated that little interchange a couple of times more until he started to make the paradigm shift and acquire a very startled look. </p>

<p>I told him I was over the spot where it fell. In a frenzy, he got out of his boat in the shallow water, rolled up his shorts up to his hips and walked onto the rocks, frenetically searching and reaching in the water for his phone. </p>

<p>Feeling what we feel, Chloe, in the Manitou, was whining desperately. It took some time, but James finally found the camera. It was standing upright in a space between two rocks—which was why it was so hard to find.</p>

<p>With the phone retrieved, we paddled mournfully to our camping spot. I was slouched in the Eskia, paddling a good distance behind and giving James plenty of space. Needles to say, when we landed, he didn’t help me out of my kayak as he usually does.</p>

<p>After about an hour, James was back to his old self and being very poetic about the whole thing. He said it was bound to happen sooner or later. The very nature of cell phones is that they easily get damaged and lost, simply because they are not wired to a wall.</p>

<p>We landed in the area were Ed Frigon’s old floating wharf used to be. All that was left was a construction of poles covered with barnacles embedded in a very mucky shoreline. Half hidden in the trees was an upside-down boat, weathered, worn, with a couple of gaping holes in the bottom—definitely no longer sea-worthy!</p>

<img src="/assets/images/post14-drakeisland/No%20longer%20sea%20worthy.JPG" alt="Drake-Island"><em>No longer seaworthy</em></p>

<p>We walked around the forest looking for places to camp. We found the “Green Throne” built by BC Marine Trails. We prided ourselves in being one of the first few people to use it! We found some flat places with nice soft moss among the trees, which was in the area of the foundation of Frigon’s hotel. We didn’t think it was a good place to have a campfire. There were too many “forest fuels” around. We admired the holly and foxgloves—plants not native to the BC wilderness—that have been growing here for over a century. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post14-drakeisland/Ferns.JPG" alt="Drake-Island"><em>Ferns</em></p>

<p>Finally, we went back out to our landing point and noticed a mound protruding out of the water. There was a small spot just big enough for our tent. There were also some rocks arranged in a circle, which was probably previously a campfire. We added a few more and it made a good fire ring. There was virtually no danger of starting a forest fire here!</p>

<p>We later found the hidden cache from BC Marine Trails that advised us to avoid having a campfire. We were going to keep our fire a secret, but I am going to go out on a limb and confess to it. The spot where we had it is probably the only safe spot to have one on the whole island. Having a fire anywhere else could surely lead to disaster. We felt, by leaving a fire ring on the rise, it will deter people from having one in a riskier place.</p>

<p>We set up camp and then took a walk in the forest, taking pictures of the foxgloves and trees and picking huckleberries. We didn’t do much for the rest of the evening except eat, roast marshmallows, drink tea and try to dry out James’ phone. </p>

<p>We watched the tide creep up slowly over the course of the evening. We kept trying to figure out if our tent would end up submerged. It was to be an especially high tide: 11ft. We were getting anxious, staying up as late as possible to figure out how close it would get. </p>

<p>I was very tired, because I hadn’t slept much the night before, and James was just tired. We weren’t willing to wait around until 2 am for the high tide point. It turned out we had miscalculated the tide readings and it would not be as bad as originally expected. We didn’t think it would reach the grass—because grass can’t grow under sea water—but we weren’t sure. We thought it might only go to the sea asparagus, in which case our tent, only on grass, should be fine, though it would have been very close.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post14-drakeisland/Sea%20asparagus%20growing%20up-side-down..JPG" alt="Drake-Island"><em>Sea asparagus growing upside-down</em></p>

<p>We ended up working ourselves into a tizzy. We decided to move the tent to a higher point just to put the issue to rest. It was too bad because the other spot was so nice and soft and grassy. At the higher spot, we had to sleep on rocks and roots! When we got up in the night, James concluded that we probably would’ve been OK down below.</p>

<p><b>July 20, 2016</b></p>

<p>The next morning, we were thinking of cancelling our trip to Quatsino. We were late for the flooding tide (this sounds a lot like catching a subway). We decided instead to paddle the last leg of the trip against the ebbing tide at a leisurely pace. We were bound to get there sooner or later. </p>

<p>We crossed the sound diagonally, seeing many passing speed boats. We saw a shoreline of houses, many of which were boarded up. Quatsino has seen better days and, I think, will see them again in the future once people discover what a paradise this is. </p>

<p>We cut around an island and a small peninsula. Finally, we came up to a lighthouse and then noticed a cove with a wharf, boats and a concentration of houses. We had finally arrived at Quatsino. We saw St. Olaf’s church and wondered if it was the church in Emily Carr’s painting, <i>The Indian Church</i>. It turned out not to be.

<p>We paddled under the wharf, and, after landing, found ourselves in the company of a community of snakes zipping about hither and thither. </p>

<p>Since I had been living in Port Alice, I had never seen Quatsino, but heard of many heard stories about it. I envisioned it as a place with aging hippies, huge gardens and peacocks running about freely. One of the residents there who has peacocks brought a huge bouquet of peacock feathers to the Legion one day. I ended up getting a few of them from the bartender I babysat for. </p>

<p>Until then, I didn’t have a boat to get to Quatsino and check it out myself. When I finally arrived, it didn’t quite live up to my perhaps over-idealized image of it. I was surprised that it looked a little dreary. This may have been because of the cloudy day. A major tragedy did happen there in 2002, where a father murdered his six children and then set his house on fire. Even further back, there was a domestic murder suicide. Perhaps the causes and effects of such events leave subtle signs and suggestions on the face of a village, the same way a person who has suffered a great loss has a permanent look of sadness in their eyes. In spite of that, I see that, one day, maybe 50 or so years from now, Quatsino will be a colourful little village (maybe even with the peacocks roaming freely) that will attract many visitors from around the world. It already does to some extent. Perhaps the Quatsino I was seeing in my mind before was a Quatsino of the future.</p>

<p>Quatsino is a very different way of life. To get anywhere, you need a boat. The community once had an opportunity to install a road, but they voted against it. Although I tend to think of Port Alice as remote, residents leave Quatsino for Port Alice to do their shopping and have a bit of social life and “culture.” </p>

<p>We went straight to the Museum, which looked like the only thing open.  We met the curator, Gwen Hansen. I asked her about Ed Frigon, and she led me to a filing cabinet. I read stuff while she and James conversed. Finally, feeling overwhelmed, I asked if I could get copies of the files. </p>

<p>A bunch of people came in who looked very Scandinavian. A very tall guy with a Scandinavian accent pointed to something on the wall and asked what it was. Gwen said it was a sasquatch comb and everybody laughed. Gwen later told me it was a herring comb, but I was still confused. I had to ask James to enlighten me. As it turns out you sweep the comb in the water, catching herring and then throwing them into your boat.</p>

<p>Chloe suddenly started whining hard. James and Chloe took leave of the museum. It turned out Chloe needed to take a really big poop! We were thankful that she didn’t take a dump in the museum! From then on, we resolved to always listen to Chloe, as she usually whines for a good reason (except when she wants extra treats).</p>

<p>We checked out St. Olaf’s church. James was just going to peek in the windows to see what’s inside. I had a more novel idea: I opened the door! It is amazing that there are still places on this planet that don’t have to be under tight security! We went inside, signed the register and took a few pictures of this tiny simple church that was originally the colony’s first school.</p>

<p>Back at our launch point, we sat and had a snack and took pictures and videos of the snakes. It is amazing that snakes can be so beautiful! And fast! In a place where time moves so slowly, it was odd to see something move like it was late for a very important meeting!</p>

<p>For the trip back to Atkin’s Cove, I was back in Tigger and James in Eeyore. We paddled over the sound surprisingly fast. We took only 15 minutes to cross it. The snakes must have given us some of their energy.</p>

<p>James may have lost his phone—and his contacts—but I also lost the starfish picture. I had hoped that it ended up on the Cloud, but it was not the case. At home, James checked out a few tricks on the internet but, alas, the phone was pronounced pooched! He phoned Telus and, luckily, only had to add on another $1OO spread out over his payments for his old phone to get a similar new one. </p>

<p>We had a chat about the various ways people we knew have lost cell phones. One person lost their phone in the toilet! Another had to get a professional diver to retrieve theirs from the ocean and it ended up not working anyway! My son goes through a lot of phones too, but he tends to be a screen breaker. We concluded that cell phones are meant to be destroyed, probably because they are carried everywhere. It is one of those unintentional (or maybe intentional?) schemes that keeps the telecommunications industry booming! </p>

	  <title>Huson Caves and Little Huson Lake: Stuck in a Labyrinth with Shifting Walls</title>

	     <p><b>October 21, 2016</b></p>

<p>Getting ready for our trip to Huson Caves, James and I were both pretty crabby. I was pooped from working at the pizza place Friday night, and James was stuck with virtually all the preparing. The only contribution I could make was to pack my own bag and water the garden. I was trying to water the garden deeply, but it was making James restless. He was eager to get going.</p>

<p>As we were packing up, Chloe was very concerned about being left. She sneaked into the truck when the door was open and refused to leave. When it came time for me to pull her out of the truck, so James could drive it out of the protective shade of the carport and the car in, you could tell there were a lot of thoughts going through her mind, and a lot of emotions.</p>

<p>On the road, we stopped at Hyde Creek for some coffee, aloe vera juice, the Gazette and the Sun. We checked our maps and determined we would have to turn onto the road to Zeballos. When we arrived at the turn, we stopped to read a map by the road, discovering, to our disappointment, there was no campsite at the caves—at least there wasn’t one showing. As it turned out, there was no “official” campsite, but there was a small unofficial one that was an absolute gem!</p>

<p>Seeing a campsite icon at Anutz Lake, we determined we would have to go right and right again—though that turned out to be a gross oversimplification of the facts. Driving down the well gravelled but narrow winding road, we saw a fork that gave us the willies. It brought back memories of our trip to Gooding Cove, where we ended up on a cut-block on top of a mountain with not much room to turn around. We listened to our instincts, which was telling us that this was not the turn we should take. They were 100% right. As it turned out, there were all kinds of roads and forks, but, thankfully, there were also regional district signs pointing the way to Anutz Lake and Huson Caves, though, not one for that first fork—which was probably the most critical one! It all is in keeping with the tradition of BC signage: of not telling you where to go until you’ve already figured out how to get there! We saw a sign that said Anutz picnic site, but we weren’t sure if that also meant it was a campsite. A truck came driving out. Assured by signs of human life, we decided to try it.</p>

<p>We penetrated the forest and followed a very narrow rugged road that seemed to be going to the ends of the Earth. We felt certain we would eventually find a nice hidden secluded place deep in the forest to pitch out tents. Instead, we found a mob! We came upon a giant family reunion, with people, kids and RVs everywhere! There seemed to be more vehicles, people and congestion there than downtown Vancouver! We couldn’t get out of there fast enough! You’d think we would have been happier to meet up with a pack of wolves! </p>

<p>We were back on the road and headed to Huson Caves, not sure what we would do about finding a campsite. As we drove, the road started looking more and more rough, narrow and forgotten. We caught sight of the butt of a big black bear before it disappeared into the shrubs. We finally came upon a pullout with information and direction signs for Huson Caves, which was the trail head. There was nowhere to camp at the trail head, but the park sign indicated a campsite further down. We drove on. The road got very dark, and steep in places. We finally came upon a dead end and a parked truck. We parked ourselves and, seeing water through the leaves, decided to take a little walk into the bushes. James went ahead of me. I later heard him say a very emphatic “Wow!” When I saw what he saw, I saw that he wasn’t kidding! We found ourselves on the shore of a very sunny small lake with a picturesque Swiss-like mountain in the distance. We were contemplating spending just one or two nights there and moving on, but those plans were promptly altered. I said I didn’t care if I sat around all day doing diddlysquat, I wanted to stay here for the whole four days. </p>

<p>The campsite is small, so it can only hold two, maximum three sets of campers. Hidden behind some bushes was the campsite of a young couple with a terrier and weiner dog. We also had a brief visit from a large crowd of people who just looked around and left. Our neighbours stayed until Monday. We had the beautiful picturesque spot all to ourselves on Tuesday. </p>

<p>We had recently bought a Nikon 3300. After pitching our tents, I went out and checked out what it could do around our campsite, which wasn’t much. I had a lot to learn. We later went out on the kayaks for a short paddle, but we didn’t have our usual amount of energy. Even Chloe seemed too pooped to kayak. Because it was the middle of the day, the water was wavy. We were heading toward other end of lake, but James hinted that it was farther than it looked. I suggested we head back. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/chloe_at_the_helm.edited.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>Chloe at the helm.</em></p>

<p>On the way back to the campsite, we thought we could go past the logs and access the caves to the north. When I saw James working hard at it, I decided to land and save that battle for another day. I needed to purge my work week out of my head before I could do anything. James paddled around the driftwood for a while. When he came back, he determined that we could paddle there to get to the caves, however far the water lets us go—which, as it turned out—wasn’t very far at all! 
We spent the rest of the evening trying to take photos of the moon and Jupiter in the dark that ended up being just squiggly lines on a black background. I used James’s app to find out what other planets we might be able to see. We found out Mars was by the moon. Neptune and Pluto were on the other side of the mountain, though probably not visible to us anyway. I was falling asleep sitting up. I dragged myself to bed without brushing my teeth and slept like a rock all night…which is a rarity for me these days. </p>

<p><b>May 22, 2016</b></p>

<p>We dawdled around camp until nearly one o’clock. We headed out on the lake toward the caves. The current lead us to the deepest spots, and we were drifting smoothly into the centre of the lake. The wind was coming from the north: we had to engage our warp drive paddle to get anywhere at all. We weren’t paddling too long when we met up with some logs blocking our path. James was surprised as, when he had kayaked here night before, that area was wide open. That was when we first realized that logs on water tend to move. Nevertheless, we could quite easily push through with our kayaks, getting hung up on a log only a time or two. I tried to take some pictures, but James complained I was going to get the camera wet by using it while in motion. He offered to hold onto my kayak, so I could get my fix of pictures for while. It worked for a bit, but not really. An artsie with a brand new SLR camera: I was a snap-happy maniac! </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/the_snap_happy_maniac.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>The snap-happy maniac.</em></p>

<p>We peered at what we thought was the entrance to the cave. It was choked up by millions of logs! Even if we had been able to somehow get past the log jam—which was impossible—we would have met up with cliffs, waterfalls, whirlpools, shallow rapids and rocks, rocks and more rocks! We overcame our denial, even though the circumstances were pretty obvious, and finally decided this route was impassable. Nonetheless, some weird part of us wanted to keep going. </p>

<p>We turned around to go back, but that was a problem! I was fiddling with the camera and quite oblivious to my surroundings. James was a bit ahead of me when I heard his expression of dismay. What? I asked, only half interested. “We’re trapped,” he moaned. In the short time that we were there, all the logs that we had passed by got pushed together by the wind after it had changed direction. It had closed the gap we had entered by and we were definitively trapped! </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/i_do_believe_we_are_in_a_pickle.edited.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>My dear, I do believe we are in a pickle!</em> </p>

<p>Panic started to set in. There were a lot of logs in our way. It seemed to be more than we had passed to get there. Maybe we could have walked on top of them all the way back to shore, but we would have had to leave our kayaks behind, or we would have had to drag them across the logs trying hard not to trip, fall into the water or damage our kayaks! We headed to a part of the lake that seemed to have less logs, though there were some gigantic ones among them. James pushed a few of the logs out of the way to make a path through the logjam. He warned me to keep close behind him or the driftwood would quickly close up and block me in. We struggled and fought, pushing and pulling on logs from our kayaks. Chloe was getting so distressed by our distress that she kept trying to crawl into my cockpit. Even though we were in the midst of catastrophe, I couldn’t help but reach for my camera several times, which, with fact that we were trapped, was making James even more irritable. What can I say, I am a slave to aesthetics! Finally, he told me to put that @#&amp;*# camera down. We managed to forge ahead, James creating openings in the logs, and I following close behind. Then we came upon a gigantic immovable log that was tightly jammed up at both ends! </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/move_you_damn_logs.edited.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>Move you damn logs!</em></p>

<p>That’s when James got out of the kayak and started jumping on top of the log in frustration (he later confessed to me that he had fun doing that)! While standing on the log, he looked around, picked up a stick and started pushing logs around. He managed to create a temporary opening for Chloe and me. Before I was able to get through, I accidentally bumped James’ empty kayak and caused it to drift away (I’m not much help in a log jam, am I?). He had to run down the log to retrieve it! With his kayak secured, he pushed the last two logs apart with his legs so Chloe and I could pass under. I really, really wanted to grab for the camera, but didn’t dare! I found some mobility by grabbing onto logs and pushing them behind me. I moved myself along in one spot by grabbing onto the short branches and pulling. James got into his kayak and followed. </p>

<p>Back at the campsite, we discovered that the campfire that we thought was out, actually wasn’t! I have to admit, I had lapsed in my vigilance. Because it had burned down and stopped producing flames and smoke, it was easy to do. By the time we came back, it was smoking again. See folks! Just because a campfire looks like its out, 
doesn’t mean it is! All it needed was the heat of the mid day and the wind to bring it back to life. </p>

<p>James then asked what we are going to do now. I said we go hiking. 
We ate our kayaking snack, then soaked our fire until we were sure it was completely out. Because we forgot to bring a day pack, we ended up having to use my laptop back pack to carry our hiking supplies. We drove back up the hill to the trail head with the park signs and the outhouses. We studied the map, read some of the info, and were off. I kept taking pictures of everything from moss to old man’s hairs. James was getting very impatient for a normally patient guy. He ended up walking ahead on his own, while I dawdled and clicked away like a woman obsessed. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/are_you_coming_or_not.edited.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>Are you coming or not?</em></p>

<p>It turned out to be a short trail. We found ourselves going down some very steep stairs to a viewing platform overlooking a rocky stream that flowed into a cave. We couldn’t see very far inside it. James jumped over the railings and out of sight. I could not see the outcropping of rock that he landed on, so it looked like he was jumping into the river. James encouraged me to jump on it with Chloe. I said no thanks and passed the camera to him. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/sheltered_waters.edited.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>Sheltered waters.</em></p>

<p>James flashed away inside the cave, then, disappeared for a while. Not knowing where he was or what he was doing, I just sat there and hoped for the best. Chloe was crying the whole time he was gone. He finally came back with a couple of pictures that were the money shots. </p>

<p>We went back up the stairs and found another set of stairs descending to a below ground oasis. The Huson Caves are part of a karst formation, caves created by gradual weather and erosion that form depressions, underwater rivers and caves. The Huson Caves themselves are carved out of a layer of limestone formed during the Upper Triassic period, over 199 million years ago. The water in a karst formation tends to flow between the layers of bedrock, rather than through joints or cracks, as other types of caves do. The canyon then became a home for vegetation, like lichens, fungi, mosses, ferns and shrubs that like to live in old growth cedar-hemlock rainforests—hence, the oasis effect. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/below_ground_oasis.edited.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>Below ground oasis.</em></p>

<p>On our way down, James checked out a dry cave and was tempted to go down a hole. He said he needed a rope to attempt it. I thanked God we didn’t have one! We both bumped our heads a couple of times. I worried about Chloe disappearing into one of the holes, so I attached her leash. </p>

<p>After descending the 300 metres to the bottom of the formation, we found ourselves standing in front of a tranquil pool before the dark mouth of the cave. Rapids cut into the canyon and flowed into to the pool and, eventually, into the cave and away. The pool itself was full of rounded boulders, with a couple of opportunistic trees growing on small rock islands. I went nuts with the camera. I took almost 500 shots at different light levels. Too bad I didn’t know how to use my camera properly at the time, but I managed to get some good shots anyway. </p>

<p>James engaged his inner child and decided he was going to leap over the creek onto a rock. He then crawled up the rock to the other side, disappearing into the darkness of the cave. I was left to wonder and wait. He came back, crawled down the rock face, leapt from the rock in the creek and demanded the camera. I resisted at first, then reluctantly surrendered it. I told him that if he wrecks it he pays for it, even though he was the one who paid for it in the first place. </p>

<p>Like he had springs for feet, James was up the rock face and gone into the darkness. He seemed to be gone for an especially long time. After envisioning how I would call 911 from this deep canyon, I started calling for him. Shortly after, he came hopping and jumping back.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/can_you_find_james.edited.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>Can you find James?</em></p>

<p>On our way back up the stairs, James got into a conversation with a hiker, talking about a hole James saw on the way down. The hiker told him where the various branches of the cave go. He showed him a hole to go in, and they crawled through, along with the guys’ wife. I decided to stay back, claiming a touch of claustrophobia, or maybe just being burnt out from taking so many photos and not being willing to crawl and creep around tight spaces on slippery rocks with a finicky Chihuahua. </p>

<p>While James was in the cave, I met our neighbours from our camping spot. They informed us about a decommissioned trail to check out. Instead of going straight back to our vehicle, we hung a left and walked passed a sign that told us not to enter. This is not a move I recommend, as there was a risk of running into things like sinkholes and underground passages…so I didn’t tell you to do this! The trail led to a dirt and rock bridge that had collapsed. Unable to proceed further, we had a good look around. We saw the other side of our lake with the logjam where we were trying to access the caves in our kayaks. We had a good laugh: we were actually thought we could paddle through that! We met a couple of batches of people on the trail and had discussions with them about secret hideaways on Vancouver Island, that is, until they found out we were bloggers and the conversations abruptly came to an end. </p>

<p>After leaving the caves, James and I later went cutting firewood at the brush piles further up the road. I sat on the truck watching him. He seemed to get carried away and cut more logs than we could ever use. We ended up taking some home at the end of our camping trip and leaving a lot behind for the next set of campers.</p>

<p>After supper, I was taking pictures of the sunset. James hopped in the kayak without saying anything and took off across the lake in the semi dark. He went quite far until I couldn’t see him. I was starting to think of calling 911 again when he eventually emerged out of the evening darkness. </p>

<p><b>May 23, 2016</b></p>

<p>James got up early, around 8, and I stayed comatose in bed until about 10. We were planning to go on the water early to benefit from the calmness. When I came out of the tent, it was cloudy. James said the waves weren’t going to do anything anyway. We hung around until about 12, walking Chloe, having breakfast and drinking lots of coffee.</p>

<p>We paddled along the rocky shore of the lake, exploring cave-like indentations, and an outcropping of rock that looked like a giant horse’s hoof. As I was dawdling behind, preoccupied with taking photos, James took off and hid around the next point. I had no trouble figuring out where he went because, paddling on a still fresh water lake, he left a very noticeable trail of bubbles in his wake. I saw a yellow line on the rocks and asked if this lake has a bit of a tide. James said it was from spring runoff, the line marking the level of the water when it was at its highest. The yellow colour comes from the tree pollen. It reminded me of a carpenter’s chalk line. </p>

<p>Lo and behold, we found <i>another</i> cabin in the BC wilderness! The water was very deep in that area, so we landed several metres away and walked to it. A few of my steps discovered sink holes, so I had to move fast. Inside the cabin, it looked like the last people there left in a fit, as there were dishes and debris scattered everywhere. When I took pictures, I stepped carefully, worrying about falling through the floor. </p>

<p>After I got back in the kayak and waited for James on the water, I heard a gun shot that told us there were people around. We paddled toward the campsite where there was an SUV. By the time we got there, the SUV was gone. Their campfire rim was still warm, but their fire was definitely out. Good show, guy, whoever you are! It later turned out he was someone James worked with. James figured it out by noticing a photo of Huson Lake on Facebook some time later and finding out who took it. </p>

<p>We walked down the river to some rapids, trying to figure out how to make the endless stream effect with the camera. We were still so woefully ignorant about the operation of our camera. We walked toward the beach and saw an odd wood construction: a wood frame facing the lake. We read the inscription on it that said, “See TV.” We sat and watched the “natural” TV program of waves on Little Huson Lake while we ate our snack. </p>

<p>The wind picked up. We realized we had better head back. I had had my fill of photos, so I took the Eskia (Tigger) this time. I noticed how tippy it was, but also how fast it was. It just slips along. The Manitou (Eeyore) seemed like a tractor by comparison, but it is a tractor we need, for Chloe and the camera box. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post13-husoncaves/chloe_with_reflections.jpg" alt="Huson Caves"><em>Shadows and reflections.</em></p>

<p>For our last evening at this special little spot, we had a supper of Greek salad and steak with Cajun spice. We started up a conversation about the camera and how to get certain effects. I asked James if he still wanted to go on a night kayak ride. He said his typical “do you want to?” which means he doesn’t really want to. I then had an idea. Since James had an alone kayak the night before, I thought it was my turn to have an alone kayak in the evening light. He promised to take some pictures of me in the hopes of getting some good ones, since I had been complaining that he takes such bad photos of me. Even though he doesn’t have much to work with, he always seems to get me at a bad angle, in a bad light, or when I’m mussed up or frumpy. If I was dressed up to the nines, probably the last thing he’d think of is to reach for the camera! </p>

<p>Going on the water alone like that, it was like a meditation. For some reason, the clutter that moves around in the brain seems to suddenly disappear. I didn’t &quot;think&quot;, and it was easy. I just listened to the birds and looked around, paddling a few strokes and then drifting. When I meditate, it is quite a discipline. Meditating alone on the kayak, though, came quite naturally. I did do some deliberate thinking though. I imagined what this place looked like before people. There would still be birds singing, but the mountains would be completely covered in trees and there would be no cut blocks or logging roads. There on the lake, I was in a timeless zone. When I came back, James actually took some not bad pictures of me, including the one where I’m sticking out my tongue (oh well, you take what you can get). Clearing one’s head can be highly beneficial in unforeseen ways. There’s nothing like a little pre-historic time travel to rid your brain of busy work week. </p>

<p>On our way back, we stopped in at Nimpkish Lake, just off highway 19, at “the sign with no sign” by a cabin at the side of the road. It was one of the special hideaways that the other hikers informed us about. Because it is a very long, Nimpkish Lake makes a good wind tunnel—not great for kayaking. I’ve read in the Backroad Mapbook for Vancouver Island that it has a few rivers flowing into it, with varying levels of difficulty, that would be suitable for kayaking. Because of the perpetual wind, it is an excellent spot for parasailing and wind surfing—and is well used in that respect. It is very scenic too, making it a good spot for a camera buff. Here are some of the pictures I took while we had a short stop there. </p>

	     <p><b>Hardy Bay, March 30, 2016</b></p>

<p>It was March…not exactly kayaking season. In many parts of the country people were still coping with snow and sub-zero temperatures. I was feeling an urgency to do some kayaking as soon as possible, which was a good feeling to heed, as there would be an unexpected turn of events that would turn our lives upside down in August. </p>

<p>Unlike in the summer, I couldn&#39;t go kayaking at any time. Because I worked at the school during the week and had an almost full-time job on the weekends, there weren&#39;t many opportunities for me to take off during the school year. James was a little freerer: he worked a half dozen 2 to 4-week mill shutdowns in the spring, summer and fall, with big breaks in between. I saw spring break coming from afar and set the wheels in motion for a kayaking trip for that time. Interestingly, the gods seemed to collaborate with my intentions. The weather on the North Island is usually quite soggy in March; however, those three days that we ended up going kayaking we had an unusual gift of mid-July type weather. </p>

<p>Things were looking good for a spring break trip, except for one hitch. I had to renew my first aid certificate for my lunch supervisor job at the school, and the course was smack dab in the middle of the spring break week we were planning to go. Also, I had to go back to work at my weekend job on Friday. We might have gone farther afield if not for that; but, as it turned out, it was a blessing. Our first kayaking trip had to be local. We considered Storeys Beach by Fort Rupert about 30 minutes away, but weren&#39;t terribly enthusiastic about it. We ended up discovering that it was a gem of a kayaking site, both &quot;exotic&quot; and suitable for almost all ages. Its funny how we tend to think how something exotic and exciting has to be far away and cost a lot of money to get to. So, if you have kids, maybe a Chihuahua or other kind of pooch and not a lot of time for a high kayaking adventure but want one anyway, try out Storeys Beach. </p>

<p>Another complication was lodgings. Our home (James moved out of his rental and into my place in November) was not too far away. There are no campsites at Storeys Beach, so we figured we had to stay at one in Port Hardy. It was a little weird. We would be camping in a municipal area, and there was still a 30 minute drive to our kayaking spot—and it was only a 45 minute drive from home! I guess we just needed to camp; it had been a long winter. We checked out two campsites, but one was closed. We ended up staying at the Quatse River Campground. Again, we were pleasantly surprised and delighted by this element in our close to home adventure. </p>

<p>We arrived at the Quatse River campground on Tuesday and had our pick of camping sites. We walked around to find the very best one, finding it hard to decide. We settled for a site on the banks of the river. We ended up moving two sites down shortly after when a giant bus-camper from Florida showed up and marred our view. Before the sun went down, I took James on a walk on the Quatse loop walking trail. I lived in Port Hardy in 2009-2010, and I used to spend a lot of time on that trail. I was under a lot of stress, so the Quatse Loop Trail, with its tall and ancient Emily Carrish trees and cut-off-from-the-world feeling, provided me with a sanctuary of peace. I was delighted to share it with someone, especially with James who also tends to like that kind of thing. </p>

<p>During the day on Wednesday, I did my duty by going to my first aid course at North Island College. After grabbing a quick bite to eat at Mo&#39;s, I met James and Chloe at the prearranged kayak launch point at the end of the sea walk on Hardy Bay. There is a little sign there indicating a kayak launch. I&#39;ve walked by that sign dozens of times and never saw it before: it is interesting how what we see is so selective. I suppose our brains would be overwhelmed if we processed everything we saw. I think this applies to nature: it is such a complex system, I think we have barely begun to know all that is there. The First Nations people from thousands of years ago might have been a lot more aware, knowledgeable and sophisticated than we industrially-oriented &quot;modern&quot; people could begin to fathom. Methinks Mother Nature has been posting a lot of signs in our reality lately, and we have been missing all but a scant few of them. James already had both kayaks on shore and was ready to go. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post12-storeysbeach/daddy_cares.jpg" alt="The Great Escape"><em>Daddy cares.</em></p>

<p>Then we wondered where to go.</p>

<p>We thought about going north but, with the wind, the water was sure to be rough where it was open to the Queen Charlotte Strait. We decided to head south toward the Quatze River estuary—the &quot;industrial&quot; area, which, surprisingly, turned out to be a lot of fun. It was a novel switch from our usual remote adventures with no or hardly any people around. We took photos of a big barge loaded with heavy construction equipment, as well as a float plane coming in for a landing overhead. We paddled around the estuary—parts of which are solid ground at other times of the day—easily seeing the sand and rocks under the water and sometimes almost running aground. At low tide, this area becomes a sandbar and a graveyard for dark, spooky, dead driftwood tree creatures. A few of those creatures were still sticking out of the water. We came close to a couple of them to pay our respects. </p>

<p>We found a spot for a picnic on the east shore. As we ate, we were the main attraction for an audience of seals peeking out of the water. On our way back to the launch point, we came across a couple of teenagers pretending to try to push each other off of a very high pier and looking, perilously, like they might succeed. I told them to &quot;be careful&quot; but was totally ignored as they seemed to be having a whale of a time. Instead, I paddled slowly and kept watching them until they looked like they were out of danger.</p>

<p>Coming back into Hardy Bay, we saw a couple of lighthouses, one by the fish plant and close to shore, and one in the middle of the bay. I looked longingly at the lighthouse in the centre of the bay. Even though I hadn&#39;t said a thing about it, James told me that going to the lighthouse wasn&#39;t going to happen this time because it was too windy, the water was too rough and it was too late in the day. Remembering our paddle to the lighthouse on Neroutsos Inlet, I wasn&#39;t going to argue. </p>

<p>Our eventful day was not over. After kayaking, we went to visit James&#39; son, Dakota, and daughter-in-law, Cassandra, and our new grand-daughter, Gabby, born in December. Back at the campground, we sat around the campfire and marvelled how bright the stars were in the March night sky. We talked about them and wondered what we were looking at. Then, James realized, that there must be an app for that! Sure enough, there was! We discovered the star that puzzled us the most was actually Jupiter. It was then that I realized—for the first time in my life—that the brightest stars that appear first in the night sky are planets. What was actually Jupiter, I used to think was the International Space Station. Before the internet, it seems like we were living in the dark ages!</p>

<p>Since we were camping in March and the nights were long, we ended up using a lot of firewood. It was chilly one too, so an extra comforter was must. After all, we were only a few days out of winter.  </p>

<p><b>Storeys Beach, March 31, 2016</b></p>

<p>We planned our trip around the weather report and it fulfilled itself exactly as predicted: three sunny days in a row with the temperatures in the mid teens! Sometimes the weather guys <i>do</i> get it right! On Friday, when we packed up to leave, the clouds came right back!</p>

<p>Storeys Beach is the shoreline of Beaver Harbour, located between Port Hardy and Fort Rupert on the east side of Vancouver Island. The shallow bay has four islands in the middle of it: Shell Island, Cattle Island, Deer Island and Eagle Island. This area is the ancestral home of Kwakiutl band of the Kwakwaka&#39;wakw First Nation, and was once a happening place, in pre-European terms: plank houses adorned with carvings and family crests housed extended families engaged in seasonal routines of hunting and gathering, as well as periodic dance rituals, dramas and potlatches. With the arrival of Europeans, a trading post was established on the Nahwitti River, north of town. When coal was discovered in 1836, the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company developed a fortified trading post at Beaver Harbour. The hamlet of Fort Rupert got its name from the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company governor, Prince Rupert, Duke of Bavaria. In 1887, a former HBC employee who married a First Nations woman, Mary Ebbets, and had numerous children (political leverage), ended up reclaiming part of the land rights of Fort Rupert back to Kwakuitl residents. Although Storeys Beach seemed quite serene and empty at first; it definitely has the feel of a place that has had a lot going on in the past…for thousands and thousands of years!  </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post12-storeysbeach/unloading_the_kayaks.jpg" alt="The Great Escape"><em>Unloading the kayaks.</em></p>

<p>The night before, we checked the weather and the tide guides to make sure we were not launching during low tide…to avoid a long walk with heavy kayaks on the especially wide beach. High tide was a 6:30 am. We launched around 11:30, right in between high and low tide. We didn&#39;t have to drag the kayaks too far. I launched in Eeyore (the slow steady kayak) and James was in Tigger (the fast bouncy kayak). I had to paddle carefully, because the water was mere centimetres from the bottom of my boat. Just when I thought I was a good way out and could paddle normally, I got stuck on a sand bar! I said to James &quot;I&#39;m stuck!&quot; perhaps sounding as if I expected him to come rescue me. He does tend to rescue me a lot, and I might be getting a little too used to it. Instead of dealing with a problem by &quot;taking the bull by the horns&quot; right away—as has been my way most of my life — I now tend to hesitate to see if someone else will take care of it for me. He snarked, &quot;I guess you are going to have to get out and walk!&quot; I replied, &quot;I know that!&quot; I got out and walked, pulling the kayak with Chloe in it. James snapped a few shots of me walking on water.  </p>

<p>Shell Island is a hang out place for all kinds of birds, mostly seagulls, though we did see some rather unfamiliar birds, including Harlequin ducks. When we approached, our arrival caused a kafuffle. Some birds took to flight, and others swam hurriedly away from us. Paddling in between Shell Island and Cattle Island, we saw two immature sea eagles perched on rocks, looking dopey and innert. At first, we thought they were Golden eagles, which is a common mistake. Young eagles look like Golden eagles until they mature and develop the dark brown body feathers and white head feathers. James came in close to snap a photo. The bird didn&#39;t move, seeming to enjoy the notoriety—or he was just too young to know any better. Seals were playing peek-a-boo with us. We drifted through the murky whitish (because of the shells) greenish water between Shell and Cattle Island, surrounded by tiny jumping fish, when we saw what looked like a totem pole and little fountains of water squirting out of the shore. With all the eagles and squirting somethings, we decided a landing at Shell Island was warranted. </p>

<p>Shell Island is a photographer&#39;s dream, with black lava boulders contrasting with the white broken shell sand. Add to that the abundance of wildlife. James and I are in the process of shopping for a new camera, bemoaning that we did not yet have it so we could use a telephoto lens on the birds. What also added to the photographic delight was the fact that James was dressed in a black T-shirt and black sun glasses which, with his pale complexion, made him match the island! I took a million pictures. We had a picnic on the white rocky beach, stripped a little, and then laid in the sun like it was the middle of the summer (remember, it was March!). We checked out what we thought was a totem pole, but actually was a sign saying, &quot;Kamsaxtte.&quot; Although I am totally ignorant of what the sign means and the significance of the island to First Nations cultures, it sounds a lot like &quot;namaste&quot; and I wouldn&#39;t doubt it has a similar meaning. I would also venture a guess that Shell Island is a spiritual sanctuary. I don&#39;t need to find this out, as the vibes are everywhere!  If anyone who is reading this knows anything more about the history and significance of the sign and Shell Island, I would appreciate it if you enter your comments at the conversation section at the foot of this post. The squirting somethings we guessed to be barnacles just under the surface of the rocks and sand. </p>

<p>After launching from Shell Island, we went in the direction of Cattle Island, where we would get ourselves into a bit of a pickle, to put it mildly. Ever since we arrived, we had been listening to intermittent flurries of sea lions barking. A fishing skiff seemed to be at the epicentre of it. Sea lions were barking at fish workers who were tossing them fish scraps. 
Fishing skiff.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post12-storeysbeach/seals_playing_peek-a-boo.jpg" alt="The Great Escape"><em>Seals playing peek-a-boo.</em></p>

<p>In another area, we saw something weird. It looked like fins and tails swimming in a circle. I moved closer. I realized that if I continued along that trajectory, I&#39;d glide right into the middle of the moving circle, which, in hindsight, would have been disastrous to say the least! James told me to take a wide berth. I went around, but had evidently already agitated the creatures in their ritual, as there was a sudden onslaught of hostile barking. I beat it away from the group, taking a quick look back at the circle. Just as I was turning my head to look, I saw the gigantic head of an enormous light grey seal bull with large black spots and a heavy set of jowls rise out of the water and give me a nasty penetrating look. No need for words! Mind reading between animals and humans definitely exists! When I was halfway around—heading toward Cattle Island the long way—the harem&#39;s barking intensified. We booted it. Chloe was getting scared and kept trying to crawl into my cockpit. Somehow, I managed to hold her back and paddle incredibly fast at the same time! Embedded in the cacophony of barking, we heard what sounded like the roar of a giant monster opening its jaws. When we thought we were far enough away, we relaxed and put down our paddles. As soon as we did that, though, the party of sea lions came rushing after us! They chased us for a couple hundred metres, then suddenly stopped. I think it was more of a threat than anything, as they could have easily caught up to us and done some serious damage. </p>

<p>We did some googling and believe we were dealing with Stellar sea lions. The females can weight as much as 350 kilograms (770 pounds) and measure up to 2 metres (7 feet). The males can weight up to 1120 kilograms (2500 pounds) measure over 3 metres (11 feet). We were being chased by several thousand kilograms of angry sea lions!</p>

<p>Deer Island is owned by the Kwakiutl First Nations (so is Shell Island, but people are allowed to go there for day trips), and is out of bounds. You have formally request permission to go there. Paddling by, we saw a bunch of raw wood constructions and a tarp over a dome shaped frame: tables and possibly a sweat lodge. Paddling around to the north, we ran into an abundance of kelp on the water. I started picking them and dropping them into my cockpit. I had images in my mind of making kelp chips in the same way I make kale chips. As we rounded the island, the kelp appeared in greater and greater abundance. I ended up filling up my cockpit and getting my shorts thoroughly soaked! James was getting impatient with me. He kept ordering me to stop, but I couldn&#39;t help sneaking a few more here and there. Just think, generations of people have probably been collecting seaweed over millennia in this very spot!</p>

<p>As we rounded Deer Island, facing the open water, the ride got rocky. I looked to the east and could see the mainland in the distance, with a whole lot of blue water in between! After our trip down the wilder side of the islands, we came around Eagle Island and landed for another picnic and some sun-bathing. As we relaxed on the pebbly beach, we marvelled at how we had hard time telling it wasn&#39;t July. We were even sun burnt in places. Our inner seasonal time clock was experiencing a lot of confusion. The trouble with feeling like it was the middle of summer is that it gave us the uneasy feeling that fall was just around the corner! It&#39;s was a unsettling thought, especially when we only said goodbye to winter a few days ago. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post12-storeysbeach/eagle_island.jpg" alt="The Great Escape"><em>Eagle Island.</em> </p>

<p>Throughout the day, we kept hearing a repetitive blast that sounded like a cannon. On Eagle Island, the sound seemed a lot closer. We looked and looked, trying to figure where it came from. We then realized that there was a flight path overhead, and that the airport was not too far away from us on shore of Vancouver Island. James figured out the blast was from canons trying to scare birds away from the landing strips. </p>

<p>The next stop on our trip was a return to Shell Island, but there was a large body of choppy water in between. James gave me the lighter kayak because he felt sorry for me, and he took the Manitou. We determined we had to do a serious warp drive paddle across, or the trip would take us all day. I was really going. James later confessed he was having a hard time keeping up with me. </p>

<p>Back at Shell Island, we turned left and headed for shore. We couldn&#39;t see our truck, and didn&#39;t know exactly where to aim. If we would have gone in at the wrong angle, we could have ended up a kilometre or two away from our launch point and we didn&#39;t have enough energy left in our bodies to correct it. We finally recognised a microwave tower that we saw when we left, and oriented ourselves with that. We saw the sea lion&#39;s love-in going on in another part of the bay and gave them a wide berth. The water was, more or less, at the same level it was when we left—we had been paddling and exploring the bay for roughly six hours. This time, though, we didn&#39;t have to walk on water. We determined that we ended up doing a serious 12-kilometre paddle. It was nice to experience a little bit of summer, even if it wasn&#39;t actually summer.  </p>

<p>When we were packing up the truck, I had thrown my seaweed into a clean garbage bag. When we got back to our campsite, I spent the evening rinsing the seaweed in fresh water from the campground tap to remove the slime, then hanging it on a line between two trees to drain and dry a bit. The next day, when we got home, I rigged a line on my balcony so the seaweed could dry further. Before it was completely dry, I made a batch of kelp chips in the same fashion as I make kale chips. Taking about half of my spoils, I cut them up into small squares, drizzled them with olive oil, and salted them just a little—just enough to bring out the flavour. Kelp already has lots of salt to start with. I put them in the oven at a low heat, about 300° Fahrenheit, (about 150° Celsius) until they became thin and crispy but still green. The first few bites were hard to get used to, because it is a slightly different taste from kale chips, but it didn&#39;t take long for me to start liking them. James missed out on the culinary experience because he was working a shut down out of town. With my busy schedule, I ended up neglecting the other half of the kelp on the line. They started to get too dry, so I took them off the line and put them in a pan under a cloth, ready to make kale chips for the next time I had a chance. By the time I got around to making them, they were way too dry and didn&#39;t crisp up in the oven properly. If you make kelp chips, cook them when they are still damp. Determined not let this wonderful nature&#39;s bounty go to waste, I threw it on my garden for fertilizer and slug repellent. </p>

	  <title>The Starfish Are Having A Party</title>

	     <p><b>October 4, 2015</b></p>

<p>We were getting some beautiful fall weather. The sun was shining, the water was calm, and the environs were accented by fall colours. The urge to go on the water was irresistible, not just for James and me, but for my neighbour across the street, retired school principal and very keen kayaker, Polly Steele. Polly was loading up her kayak in the warm October sun the same time we were. Just like geese, who start their migrations in response to certain cues in the environment, as soon as the sun comes out on a fall day, kayakers head to the water. Polly spends a lot more time on the water than we do. Very often, if you look onto the water on a calm morning and see the tiny shadow of a kayaker, it is probably Polly. It is amazing that there are not more kayakers on the inlet in the mornings. If you are a seriously addicted kayaker, Port Alice is the perfect place to live or own a vacation property, not just because the inlet is sheltered from the waves and winds of the open ocean, but because the water is easily accessible from civilization. If you get the urge to kayak, you can have your butt on the water in no time! You don’t have to load up your vehicle with a bunch of camping gear and drive for hours and hours to find a beautiful quiet place to kayak.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post11-starfishparty/fall_colours.jpg" alt="The Starfish Party"><em>Fall colours.</em></p>

<p>We went down to the Marina; Polly arrived shortly after. While James was unloading the kayaks, Polly and I talked about the election. It is funny to think back to that conversation, and how neither one of us had a clue about the big surprise that was due on election night.  </p>

<p>Because she had a fancy dansy kayak rack, Polly unloaded her kayak lickety split and was off on the water and gone while we were still unstrapping ours! I took “Tigger,” the fast bouncy kayak, and James took “Eeyore,” the slow steady kayak. We went around the breakwater, then headed for the Frigon Island group. It was easy going. There was no wind; the water’s surface was like a mirror. Going in between the two islands, a sea lion barked at us. We looked around. We saw him just as he surfaced and then dove into the water. He was huge, at least a couple of metres long! We could tell, by the menacing sound of his barking, that he didn’t like having us around. In spite of his territorial theatrics, he didn’t bother us after that. He was just letting us know how big he was, and that he was keeping an eye on us. </p>

<p>The water was especially clear, as the mill had been down for a while. Although pulp mills have to conform to very strict environmental controls these days, they still have an effect on the water. It is a stark contrast to what the mill was like in the 1980s. People tell me that the air back that was thick with smog and that the water was virtually devoid of aquatic life, with all kinds of strange coloured substances floating in the water. People who protested the mill back then coined the name “Neurosis Inlet” as a way of voicing their objections. Oddly, today, the locals seem to still call it “Neurosis Inlet”, not realizing or not caring for the subtle difference in pronunciation between “Neurosis” and “Neroutsos.”</p>

<p>We noticed an abundance of jelly fish. They came beside our boats, one after another, doing their weird little swim. Either there were a lot of jelly fish, or they were purposefully coming by to check us out. We passed a reef by the islands and saw a multitude of starfish having a starfish party! As we were paddling around the starfish, Polly came by. She and James chatted about how clear the water was, and about the recent abundance of sea lions and whales. I was being obsessive, trying to get the absolute best shots of starfish. I was having a hard time getting a good compositional arrangement to photograph because, as soon as I had a good one, the kayak moved and altered it! I became flustered, trying to paddle to the perfect spot for a photo and then snapping it fast enough, worrying that I might end up dropping the phone in the water. After a while, I snapped photos nearly indiscriminately, hoping that I incidentally got in a few good shots. Eventually, James ordered me to curb my frenzied photography. I complied, simply because I was getting frustrated. Polly took off and went to the south part of the island. James and I went across the inlet to check out a river. </p>

<p>After eons of coughing out rocks, boulders and wood into the inlet, the small sparkling river created a huge underwater mountain. It made for a wide stretch of shallow water for us to walk in up to our ankles, as well as a habitat for seaweed, sea onion and sea asparagus. With massive pieces of driftwood lying around, the sand bar looked like a graveyard for monster trees from Lord of the Rings. We stopped and took a bunch of pictures on a big snag. Chloe posed for pictures, looking like a hero dog in an animal adventure series. I took a bunch of photos of James hopping on the giant piece of driftwood—which made my knee cringe! </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post11-starfishparty/a_dog&#x27;s_boat.jpg" alt="The Starfish Party"><em>A dog’s boat is her castle.</em> </p>

<p>Back at the kayaks, we walked in shallow water for quite a distance before hopping in. We were contemplating a picnic, but decided on having one on the Frigon Islands instead, as there weren’t any dry comfortable places to sit. James tried to paddle up the river, but, with the tide going out, he wasn’t able to get very far. On the way to the islands, I commented that the water’s surface seemed convex: that shortly after we left shore we seemed to sink down a miniscule amount and go lower as we got closer to the centre of the inlet. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post11-starfishparty/south_view_from.jpg" alt="The Starfish Party"><em>South view from the Frigon Islands.</em></p>

<p>Sitting on our blanket and eating on the sand bridge between the Frigon Islands, a crow protested that he wasn’t invited to our picnic. We threw crackers and grapes at him. Sometimes he ate them right away, other times he carried something off to a hiding spot. We had to throw our givings a good distance. If we didn’t throw them far enough, he wouldn’t come close to get them. 
Casting off for home, we drifted by an Inuksuk on the south island. In the last couple of years, there has been an mysterious invasion of inuksuk’s in Port Alice. They appeared in healthy numbers by the kayak launch, on the islands and on the shores of Neroutsos Inlet. Some would crumble back to the elements, then more would appear. They were the talk of the town for quite a while, as people tried to figure out who their creator was. One day, I discussed this mystery with one of Port Alice’s resident professional photographers, Darrell McIntosh, and he confessed it was he who made them. Since he often makes calendars of his nature photography to sell, I suggested he make one with his inuksuks. He hummed and hawed about it at first, but, eventually, he did it! That was already a couple of years back. </p>

<p>Chloe stared at the inuksuk like it was a real person or animal. She even barked at it! There’s something about Chloe and sculptures! When we were in a car rental agency this last Christmas 2016, she became very distressed by the presence of a carved wooden Santa Claus they had in the front lobby. Talk about the power of art! Even animals can have a sense of it! 
James took a picture of Chloe looking at the Inuksuk. I told him to take a picture of the Inuksuk too, but—tired of all the picture-taking—he protested. When he paddled around the island, he got a change of heart. When I finally caught up to him, he confessed that he ended up taking the picture anyway. I have to thank the gods for that intervention! This story would have been sorely incomplete without it, and James later had to agree. </p>

<p>And this, folks, is the end of the story for our 2015 kayaking season. By the time I finished writing this post (January 2017), there have been a few changes in Port Alice thanks, I believe, to our town’s various web promotions, including portalicelife.ca, vancouverislandhiddengem.com, and chloethekayakingchihuahua.com. Though this is hardly quantitative, many of the locals have been commenting that there has been more tourist activity in Port Alice. One more concrete sign of this is that the local grocery store, F.P. Foods (now called Port Alice Family Foods) opened its doors from 8 to 8 in the summer! The latest I remember them staying open is 7 pm—and that was when the mill was open! </p>

<p>I think kayaking is a very good way to spend our time here on Earth, and even a good way to enliven our economy to a degree. It’s great physical activity, keeping us healthy and fit—even for us oldies with bad knees! The activity itself doesn’t require oil or gasoline, and doesn’t churn up the water or introduce hazards that affect animal life the way motor boats do. We need some of that oil and gas to make kayaks, but they can last a long time. One kayak can last a lifetime, and maybe even a couple more after that—unlike most cars! Kayaking provides us with more opportunities to interact with our animal and fish friends, promoting more awareness of and empathy for our ecosystem. It’s hard to take care of nature’s creatures if we are not even aware that they are there, and that they have intelligence, personalities, and that they even like to be funny sometimes.</p>

<p>Kayaking also helps us to explore those beautiful idyllic settings that are just around the corner, that we may have lived near all our lives and not really seen or appreciated. Who says you have to spend a bunch of money to fly for hours in a plane to a place considered to be exotic? We have oodles of exotic, peaceful and beautiful bodies of water to visit right here in Canada, some of which rarely see people. Canada has over 30,000 lakes larger than three square kilometres—that’s a lot of places to kayak! Whether they are in the west, the east, the far north or in a municipal area, there is something magical about all of them! Mother Nature is an artist who doesn’t skimp on quality.</p>

<p>Our societies’ focus on buying and selling things has gotten out of hand, and we need to change course. Instead of being addicted to buying stuff that, half the time, we don’t need and that just ends up in the land fill, I think we would be better off spending our money on generating “positive experiences.” We can even base a vibrant economy on such “ephemeral” things. It doesn’t have to be primarily based on the exchange of solid, material objects. </p>

<p>I have a pact with James and my son. We exchange gifts at Christmas, a little reluctantly, but for every other occasion, we celebrate with a nice dinner or a night out. We have to eat or be entertained anyway. We don’t end up with a bunch of junk that we have no place to put. There is a limit to how many gadgets a person can actually use. In fact, in many material-object-based industries, like the fashion industry, products have to be regularly destroyed to keep up demand. </p>

<p>The best thing about kayaking, is that it can be a spiritual experience. We can miss so much of what is going on in “reality,” as the TV slowly and insidiously reconstructs our perspective. Kayaking teaches us about various other “worlds” out there, from the worlds of plants and animals… to the long lost cultures of First Nations people (who have maintained this planet for millennia without bringing it to the brink of destruction)…to that space in the silence of nature that helps us be more creative—and that just might provide us with the solutions to all our problems.  </p>

	     <p><b>September 3, 2015</b></p>

<p>James and I often go out to Rupert Inlet to camp with his son, Dakota, and daughter-in-law, Cassandra, and a lot of their friends and neighbours. The land is owned by Western Forest Products, and people get to camp there by their good graces. The sites are undeveloped, but there are the necessary couple of outhouses for sanitation, and the view is amazing! The time spent there is taken up by catching prawns and crab, digging for clams, picking berries and sea asparagus, cooking, eating, drinking and socializing around the fire…the usual North Island weekend warrior kind of stuff. It doesn’t make for much of a story; or, it makes for too much of a story…so I won’t bother delving into it. I will simply cut down my workload and share some of our photos. On this trip James brought his daughter Tyra and her dog Sweetie up from Campbell River. One afternoon James, Tyra, Sweetie, Chloe and I broke away from the party and went kayaking out onto the inlet. On the way back, we kayaked up Rupert Creek, passing under the bridge and winding through the forest until we could go no further. Coming back around the estuary, Tyra noticed a house in the bush and wanted to check it out. Being adventurous and curious people, we obliged her and found quite a surprise indeed! It was an abandoned house, slowly destructing over the years and pregnant with hidden stories.</p>

<p>To get to Rupert Arm, turn left from Highway 19 at the Port Alice turnoff to Highway 30, “The Port Alice Road.” Follow it for 10.6 kilometres, until you reach a gravel road crossing the pavement, and take a right onto Hardy Main. Follow the gravel road until it loops around. It should only take a few minutes go get there. Be careful to stay on the main road. There are at least a half dozen possible wrong turns you could take that could lead you heck knows where! You will pass the fork in the road that leads to Varney Bay to your left, so stay right. After the loop, you will start noticing the inlet through the trees and several driveways going to the shore. One is private property and the other ones lead to camping spots. When you see the outhouses, the main road veers away. You need to get off the road before it does. Take the left fork by the outhouses and it will lead you to the last camping site, which is the one we usually camp at. Keep in mind, they tend to fill up on weekends, especially long weekends in the summer, so get there early, go there during the week, or have an alternative in mind in case it’s full. Maybe James, Chloe and I will see your there someday! </p>

	  <title>Neroutsos Inlet: When the Ocean Sneezes…!</title>

	     <p><b>August 10, 2015</b></p>

<p>Because I had to work and wasn’t available for kayaking, James decided to paddle the inlet on his own. Chloe stayed at home. James would end up having plenty of company anyway. He launched at the transfer station around noon. Not a good time to launch—and he would pay for it later! It was a bit cloudy, so the water was calm. With the tide flooding into the inlet, he paddled easily south toward the marina and the Frigon and Walk Out Islands. James was contemplating visiting his friend and old work buddy, Russell Inglis, who lives on the other side of the inlet, when suddenly, in the quiet of the cloudy day, he heard a sound that made him think that the ocean had sneezed! </p>

<p>Startled, he looked around for the source of the explosive sound. About 200 to 300 metres away from him, a whale had surfaced and was putting on a good show. It did some shallow dives, breached up, arched its tail and then went into a deep dive, not coming up for 4 or 5 minutes! It was a very surreal experience, out on the ocean with another animal the size of an airplane! When writing up this post, I asked James if he felt a sense of connection with the whale. He put down his cell phone and developed a quizzical expression. After a few seconds of silence, he answered, “I guess so. It was just him and me on the water.” James took some pictures, but they were taken after the breaching and didn’t do justice to the whole experience.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post9-whalesitting/the_whale.jpg" alt="Whale Sitting"><em>The whale.</em></p>

<p>I find it curious how there are so many videos of kayakers encountering whales without incident. Sometimes they even come within a hair’s breath of the kayak, without even rocking the boat. It is amazing that such massive creatures can be so careful and exacting in their movements, demonstrating a basic respect for diminutive creatures like us—as well as a certain playfulness. Like the seals and the sea lions, they like to tease and flirt. </p>

<p>James carried on to Russell’s place. First his dog came out to meet him, then Russell came to check out the commotion. Russell is an always jovial guy with a a very off-handed sense of humour and permanent devilish gleam in his eye. His property is an acreage on the underpopulated side of the inlet. His family gets many of their needs met from the land, having gardens, chickens, goats and access to prime fishing from the inlet. Even though they live in a fairly remote secluded place, it doesn’t prevent them from going out and about. When the family goes to the Legion Thursday nights for darts league, they often go by boat!  The whole family, including the in-laws, are all dart sharks and usually go home with prize money from tournaments quite consistently! I got paired up with Russell in a doubles tournament once and we won first prize! See, that’s how good of a dart player he is: that he can be paired up with a greenhorn like me and win! I wasn’t doing too badly that night, though, and got in some lucky shots at the right time that helped keep us out in front. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post9-whalesitting/russell_inglis.jpg" alt="Whale Sitting"><em>Russell Inglis.</em></p>

<p>Russell gave James a tour of the property. He showed him his sawmill, an old jeep that he was working on, and some of the things left by his father that he was planning to fix and sell. He introduced James to the goats and chickens, showed him a little greenhouse that he built, then showed him his son’s place a little further up the hill that was close to the finishing stages of construction. They then went into the house for a coffee and a beer. Like every conversation in town as of late, after talk about family and acquaintances, there is discussion about whether or not the mill will reopen. The visit was topped off by a trip in Russell’s skiff to his special fishing spot where they pulled up a large steel and very heavy crab trap full of crabs. Bringing the crabs back to the dock, Russell put some in a live well and processed a couple for James to put in his little kayaking cooler for the trip back.  </p>

<p>After leaving Russell’s little North Island oasis, James Paddled directly across the inlet. He received another greeting from his buddy, the whale, hearing a blow hole on the west side of the inlet, in the direction of the mill. By this time, it was getting sunny. The wind was picking up and blowing in his face. Paddling was getting a lot harder. His arms were getting tired, so he took a break in a little bay near Walk Out Island.  As soon as he left the protection of the Frigon Islands, the wind intensified. He contemplated pulling into the marina and walking back to the truck on the other side of town. In the end, he decided he was due for a work out, and he <i>definitely</i> got one! For about three kilometres he paddled with all his might, not getting very far very fast. He thinks he was paddling 6 or 7 knots, and going back 3. For those of you who are land lubbers, a knot is equivalent to almost two kilometres per hour. At the last little bit, he had to crank up the intensity to be able to get anywhere at all. Needless to say, he was happy to see his landing spot. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post9-whalesitting/port_alice_pulpmill.jpg" alt="Whale Sitting"><em>The Port Alice Pulp Mill.</em></p>

<p>Sitting on the shore, he took some time to recoup his strength and evaluate how many parts of his body were sore…but the wind wasn’t done with him yet! To add insult to injury, he had to wrestle with the wind as he struggled to mount the kayak on top of the truck all by himself. </p>

	     <p><b>August 4, 2015</b></p>

<p>Gooding Cove turned out to be our “adventure of misadventure”—and the misadventures were on straight out of the gate! On our way to the Wild West Coast, we followed Marine drive around the south end of Neroutsos inlet. Because I was so busy with my several part time jobs, I had to leave the research of how to get there all to James. I was blissfully tuned out as he was navigating. He followed the instructions in the BC Coast Explorer, telling us to follow Cayuse Main. We took a turn on Cayuse Main, driving for quite a while on a very undeveloped road, until, after coming up on a couple of fallen trees, James said a despondent “something’s wrong.” I was inclined to start chopping, but, as I later learned, the road to the Wild West Coast was a well enough travelled road that it should have been clear. We put our heads together and studied the book and the maps and figured out the <i>BC Coast Explorer</i> probably had a typo. We turned around and went back to Marine Drive. We followed it until it “became” Teeta Main (no turns taken) and just continued on. We then felt we were on the right track. </p>

<p>So, if you’re going the Wild West Coast, do not take Cayuse Main! It would probably lead you there eventually, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you happen to be driving a bull dozer! Just follow Marine Drive until it <i>becomes</i> Teeta Main. After that, follow the rest of the instructions in the <i>BC Coast Explorer</i>. As we were driving along Teeta Main, looking for the switchback that was supposed to be 25 km from Port Alice, checking out this side road and that side road and wondering if that was it, what did we come across but a great…big…LOGGING TRUCK! James turned very white! He shifted the truck into reverse and goosed it! Luckily, the logging truck had been slowing down to make a turn from a side road onto Teeta Main, and he was able to stop in time. It was obviously a little bit sooner than he expected, as his cab bucked up and down harshly from the abrupt deceleration. Realizing the logging truck had stopped, James shifted the truck into drive and goosed ahead! As we made our getaway, he informed me that our bacon was probably saved by the other pick up trucks that had passed us earlier, warning the logging truck drivers over the two way radios about a couple of yahoos with kayaks. </p>

<p>I have mentioned this before, but I will mention it again: if you don’t have the foolhardiness to travel on logging roads while the logging trucks are working, avoid travel between 6 am and 6 pm on weekdays. There are many stories around the Island of people who were seriously injured and even killed meeting up with a logging truck. Because logging trucks have the right of way, they are not even liable if they run into you. Some roads are not too bad, such as this one to Gooding Cove and Side Bay, as they are quite wide and have enough room to let two vehicles pass—in most places at least! It helps that James is familiar with logging roads, but I’m going to push for travel after 6 pm from now on, when feasible. If you come from a place where logging roads are a remote concept, you should travel during the safe hours, or better yet, hire a local to guide you. The village office/tourist information centre can give you some good leads. There is talk in Port Alice about having bus tours to Side Bay and Gooding Cove, but the idea is still in the “contemplative” stages at this time.</p>

<p>You might notice that on one of the signs in this photo, it says there is logging activity seven days a week. I’m not sure what to say about that, as there was a much greater preponderance of signs saying there is activity only on weekdays. Also, there is a mantra going around Port Alice that says “loggers keep banking hours.” In our travels, we haven’t seen any activity on weekends. I do know, that on the road to Link River, gravel trucks travel seven days a week and we need be careful about that. I’d say that travel on the weekends is generally safe, but, as with everything in life, there might be exceptions. Keep your eyes peeled at all times anyway. </p>

<p>We finally came across the switchback as described in <i>BC Coast Explorer</i>, and were heading up on K500, then on K main over the mountain pass. From K Main, we went on I main, then J main. As we got closer to the Wild West Coast, there were bold red and white hand painted signs pointing the way to Side Bay and Gooding Cove (I guess if you managed to make it this far, you finally earned the right to know where you’re going) so we were able to put down our books and maps. The road was pretty good in some places, and it even became a two lane highway in one stretch. It turned out to be a nice drive for a while. All the forks in the road had direction signs…except for one…and that was a problem! </p>

<p>After we passed LeMare Lake we came across a fork in the road with a sign post that didn’t have a sign. We pondered and debated which one to take. We took the road to the right, thinking that the cove would be just on the other side of the ridge. It <i>definitely</i> turned out to be the road less travelled….to our chagrin! As we were driving, it struck me that it seemed like we were going up, but we couldn’t tell for sure because the trees were masking our surroundings. I started turning to a Nervous Nellie, complaining that this road was giving me a bad feeling. We debated and debated, but kept wondering what was behind the next rise. We drove up one rise only to find another one, which lead to another debate about whether or not we should take it. By the time we were certain we were on the wrong path, we were greeted by a spectacular panoramic view of the Quatsino Sound! </p>

<p>We found ourselves on a mountain cut block and quite nearly at the very top! We stopped at a little pull-out (emphasis on the “little”) because I really had to get out. My Nervous Nellie jitters turned into a full blown panic attack. I got out of the truck and didn’t care if I had to walk all the way down! Even so, I still grabbed the camera and took numerous shots of the incredible view! I couldn’t conceive how anyone could turn around on that narrow road with not much of a pull out, but somehow James did it! When I got back to Port Alice, I told one of my bosses, Rhetta Vesna at the Ozzieland Campground, about this. She informed me that she and her husband, Ozzie, ended up doing the very same thing back in the day…except, they didn’t just have a measly little pick up truck…they had a truck and trailer! Somehow they lived to tell about it! Rhetta says that’s probably why she has heart trouble today!</p>

<p>At the bottom, we took the other fork, crossed the bridge over Lamere River and passed by a rock slide that gave us cause to pause. On Restless Main, we passed Harvey Cove, stopping a couple times to take pictures. Arriving at Gooding Cove, we met a couple of campers and had a chat with them before setting up. They warned us not to drive on the sandy beach with our 2-wheel drive. They suggested instead that we camp on a ledge at the side of the cove that was close to the road. To camp on the beach would have meant too much walking with our heavy gear, so we agreed that the ledge was the solution. We mentioned we were bloggers and got quite a reaction. They suddenly got horrified looks on their faces and begged us to not tell anyone about this place. How’s <i>that</i> an endorsement for you! I figure if only a handful of people know about places like this, they may end up getting used for some less than aesthetic purpose. The more people that know about places like Gooding Cove, the more likely they will be preserved and protected. </p>

<p>After setting up camp, we went for a walk along the beach. We contemplated going for a paddle, but we were too burnt out from the trip. We spent the night sitting around the campfire, watching the flames and not saying very much. Perhaps we were clearing our minds in preparation for the next day’s misadventures. </p>

<p><b>August 5, 2015</b></p>

<p>It rained all night. Luckily, it was a fairly light rain. James got up in a frenzy in the middle of the night. Our tent had become the location of a new mini lake! We had a tarp under the tent (as well as over), but part of it was extending past the tent, catching water and causing it to flow down the slight slope and straight under our air mattress!  After James went out and made some adjustments to our tarps, we fell back to sleep. We woke up again around 8 am to the sound of raindrops hitting our tarp and waves crashing down below. </p>

<p>We opened the tent to find a miserable day out there, but it was only drizzling, not pouring. We contemplated what we should do, even considering going back home. We certainly felt frustrated enough to do so. The whole discussion was resolved by us falling gently back to sleep. When we got up at about 10:30, James opened the tent and peeked outside and proclaimed a couple of spots of blue sky. We felt hopeful. We took our time getting up, starting a campfire in the drizzle. The clouds seemed to anchor themselves just over the cove and the sun stayed out at sea. After a while, the clouds started to shuffle back and forth over the shore, causing the weather over us to alternate between drizzle and sunshine. I did my forest fire lookout weather forecasting and determined we had a short window of opportunity. I was a bit rushed, feeling we had to go soon or we would be going home unkayaked, but James wanted to deal with our wet clothes and the water problem in our tent. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/tent_view.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>The view from our tent.</em>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/anchor_clouds.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Clouds anchored over the cove.</em></p>

<p>We lassoed a couple of saplings to make a clothes line. When I went into the tent to clean it out, it felt like a sauna. I removed all the clothes, putting the wettest ones on the line to half dry in the drizzle. We put our semi dry stuff and critical sleeping bags in the truck, so at least they wouldn’t get wetter. I lifted out the air mattress, finding a significant body of water. I took out the mattress and flipped it over so it could dry out in the occasional bits of sunshine. After soaking up what I could with a towel, I lifted the tarp off of the window in the back of the tent to create some air flow. I tied open the front entrance and left the tent to dry out…somewhat. </p>

<p>James and I quibbled over the campfire again. We put the bucket of water we had on it, but it was still smoking. I wanted to put another bucket on it, but he accused me of being over the top with this fire thing. He then told me to get the bucket myself. So I did. I found the wash water from last night and put that on the fire, but it was still smouldering. I went down the long way around the rocks to get more water. As I was getting my water, I looked up at James sitting on the camp chairs, and he didn’t look too happy. As I came back up the hill, he started walking down to the beach with the stuff for our kayaking trip, still very disgruntled. </p>

<p>After I satisfied myself that the fire was sufficiently out, I met him at the kayaks. There was one more fire that needed to be put out. James eventually apologized for getting mad at me. I told him, that I wouldn’t feel very comfortable out there kayaking knowing that the fire wasn’t completely out. Since he’s a pipe fitter, I told him it would be like him fixing a pipe and leaving a very small leak. He seemed to connect with the metaphor. Although the air above ground was wet on this day, the ground underneath, with all the dried leaves and other organic matter that is the “fuel” for a forest fire, was very dry. The rain was only wetting the ground’s surface and not sinking in very far. I could quite literally “feel” the dryness beneath me. I might have seemed “over the top” because the weather was so miserable. After eighteen seasons of taking weather calculations and seeing how they affect fire behaviour, I wasn’t fooled by the light rain. We had been having a long dry summer: it would take several days of heavy rain to bring the hazard down to safe levels. Even then, you should still be vigilant about putting out your campfires. As I explained in my Link River post, fires have ways of burning in low hazard, over a long cold snowy winter, and even underground for a hundred years or more!</p>

<p>It seemed to be a rough start to the day all over. Dozy and uncoordinated, we carried the kayaks down to the shore to about the middle. We had Chloe in the kayak and were sort of lined up to launch—except I wasn’t in it yet. As I was trying to push the kayak onto the water and hop in, a big wave came in and landed on Chloe! She had such a look of ultimate betrayal in her face! I thought she was going to hate us forever! We both felt like terrible parents! Chloe’s blankets were soaked, and she was soaked! I picked her up in my arms and cuddled and consoled her a while in some dry blankets while we tried to figure out what to do next. We considered everything, from giving up to going to the quieter part of the cove. We thought about switching kayaks but, in the end, James decided to go in the water a little and pull me out. He probably shouldn’t have been in the front of my kayak.  When it came time for me to paddle like a demon, I accidentally smacked him in the head with my paddle (take that for not letting me put out my campfire!) Alas alack, Chloe and I made it out past the breakers without getting soaked. I apologized profusely for smacking James, but he didn’t look like he was in too much pain because he was laughing. 
On the water, I couldn’t find my pedals. We had to paddle to a quieter part of the cove and get me adjusted (something we should have done before we launched). The big differential between the highs and the lows of the water level was giving me a bad case of turn-backitis; but, as soon as we were on the water, James was in charge and we were going. Sounding very professorial, he instructed me to avoid certain rocks, larger swells and breakers. Because it seemed like he knew what he was doing, I followed faithfully. At the mouth of the cove, paddling on the open ocean, we saw a wave farther out that was a huge fan of water splashing up 3 metres or more! The rocks the helped produce it were hiding stealthfully just below the surface of the water! I hate to think what would have happened to us if we were anywhere near there! We navigated between the spot with the scary wave and the rocks with the breakers, going up and down, up and down on the big swells. Finally, James paddled out ahead to check things out around the point and I stayed back. After he had a good look, he waved at me to follow. Swallowing my prairie chicken fear, and strongly resisting the temptation to go straight back to the shore, I did as he ordered. He told me to go slow and take my time. </p>

<p>After a short stretch on rocky open ocean, we soon found ourselves in a tranquil cove with plenty of rock formations and islands. Staying close to shore, we snapped pictures and reveled in the beauty of the rocks, the islands and the marine life. James was looking for a cabin that was built by a friend of his that was supposed to be somewhere there. We saw a cabin, but it turned out to be someone else’s. Before heading there, we took the roundabout route, paddling between the rocks and islands. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/smoothpaddling.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Smooth paddling.</em></p>

<p>Passing over calm waters between two rocks in between two islands, I felt my kayak suddenly rise up! I screeched at James, but it wasn’t enough warning. I rose about a metre into the air, but managed to avoid a splashing! Instead, James, who was little ahead of me, got swamped! It was a rogue wave! I remembered that when I paddled up to the rocks and looked out at the ocean, I could see no sign of waves for at least a kilometre! That mischievous wave had sneaked into the cove incognito, suddenly appearing under us the very moment we were passing between the two innocuous rocks. One is inclined to thing there was some kind of intelligence at work here! Thankfully, Chloe didn’t get swamped a second time, as she was in the Manitou with me. James, on the other hand, had to pull out the bilge pump. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/flat_water.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Don’t let this flat water fool you!</em></p>

<p>On the way to the cabin, we said hello to Mr. Jellyfish and took some pictures. At the cabin, we delighted in using a real outhouse! We saw a folding chair sitting under a bunch of fishing floats hanging in the trees. The cabin looked nice on the outside, but it was very bare bones on the inside. The walls were made of unpainted particle board and it had few furnishings, essentially a big shelf full of cots. We found a guest book that had been written in extensively, possibly over the space of decades. I didn’t spend too much time reading, but noticed one passage where the guests had to contend with rats. Because it was cool and dreary inside, we went outside to have our snack. We walked around the beach and checked out the rocks. We found wild strawberries growing high up on a couple of large rocks on shore, their tiny habitat being high enough to be safe from the tides and waves.  </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/ded_jelly.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>Deceased jellyfish.</em></p>

<p>We left the cabin and paddled to the point to check out Restless Bight to the south. James went out ahead of me to scout but, seeing high winds and a lot of breakers, he called off the attempt. On our way back, a large seal or sea lion had some fun with the tourists. He did a flip out of the water behind us, causing a noisy splash and making us jump. 
That rogue wave must have seriously spooked James. As we were going back around the point back to Gooding Cove, he was ahead and I was well behind. I was taking my time, because he told me to do that before. He started complaining about my slow pace, so I geared into my warp drive paddle. We rounded the point, riding high swells and keeping our eyes on the breakers further out to sea. Perhaps James realized we could easily be hit by a rogue wave again; but, on the open ocean, it would have been a lot more devastating! It was probably only the luck of the draw that we didn’t. The water was turbulent probably because of the stormy weather. On a calm sunny or generally overcast day, the trip might not be so risky. </p>

<p>I was glad when the point was behind us, but we still had to ride high swells all the way back to the shore. We decided to go far to the right on the beach that was more protected. The waves weren’t that bad by then though, and we probably could have landed in the centre. We walked back, looking for a walking stick for me because my knee was bugging me. As we were sitting on a log and looking at the bay and our kayaks, it occurred to me that we should name our kayaks. Calling them by their product name was a little too formal. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post7-gooding/gooding_cove_view.jpg" alt="Gooding Cove"><em>View from Gooding Cove.</em></p>

<p>We got a fire going again—which was really hard because it was so wet (I wonder whose fault that is!)—and cooked up all our remaining meat, including steak and pork chops. We sat by our campfire watching it burn and listening to the crashing of the waves. I so love doing nothing sometimes!</p>

<p><b>August 6, 2015</b></p>

<p>It was dry in the morning, but we kept sleeping in our tents. As I was laying there, I contemplated the naming of our kayaks. I thought about naming the Eskia “Donovan Bailey” or “Andre Degrasse” because it was the fast one. Because the Manitou sounded like Manitoba, I thought about naming it after Winnipeg, as like in Winnie the Poo. Then I thought about the characters in Winnie the Poo. I thought, because the Manitou was the slower steady kayak, it should be named “Eeyore.” Then it occurred to me that we should name the Eskia “Tigger,” because it was the fast bouncy kayak. James had a laugh and seemed to agree. From then on, our kayaks were named Eeyore and Tigger. It is probably very apropos, since I’m a children’s author, and James is a children’s author’s boyfriend, who, by the way, is also a remarkably kid friendly person. We don’t have too many disagreements on how to deal with children (like we do about putting out campfires). </p>

<p>By the time we were out of our tent, it was raining steadily. James went to get the kayaks to put them on the truck. I stayed back and dismantled the tent. Even though we hadn’t started a fire that morning, when James wasn’t looking, I dumped some water on our campfire pit. Even though it didn’t look like it was burning and it was raining lightly, the fire pit hissed like a pit of snakes! Even <i>I</i> was surprised by this! That fire looked dead, but it was full on alive! </p>

<p>As we were packing up, our neighbours left and some new campers came by. We were worried that my two-wheel drive would not be able to make it up the road in the rain. We asked the new possible campers to look out for us. It was a good thing, as it turned out they were just about to leave. I got out of the truck to lighten the load. James made it up, giving a happy toot when he made it to the top. Otherwise, we might have been stuck there a few days!  </p>

<p>We were planning to go to Side Bay for at least a quick look, but, because of the rain, we felt an urgency to get back. James left the final decision to me and I decided against. James later said it was a good thing, because, if we had gone there, we would have been coming back late at night, which, on long lonely logging roads, is not a pleasant notion—especially if we suddenly find ourselves on the top of a mountain with nowhere to turn around! </p>

<p>Driving back, we kept hearing a strange noise. I thought it was my differential (I forgot I used to have problems with it). After stopping a few times, we finally figured out it was because I didn’t twist the straps that hold the kayaks and it was causing “harmonic vibration.” In fact, I tried to make them especially flat and straight because I thought it was more aesthetic…silly artsie me! Alas alack, it wasn’t my differential! After fixing the straps by giving them a few twists, we continued on the slow long two and a half hour journey in the rain along logging roads J, I and K. Every once in a while, we had to stop to adjust our foam pads that kept falling out of place, as well as have a listen for the rumble of logging trucks in the distance. </p>

<p>Going over the mountain pass we took to get there, we found it much scarier than the trip the other way. There were no guard rails and we had a full on view of the very steep drop! Going up we were oblivious, as that scene was behind us. We inched along. I had to look away to avoid a panic attack. James was very cool, but I could tell he wasn’t at ease about it either. </p>

<p>Relieved to be past the scary part, we stopped at an overgrown campsite just below the pass and took pictures of the mill across the inlet. It’s funny how the mill, such a massive complex that is such a big part of people’s lives in Port Alice, looks so miniature in the expanse of nature! It makes you realize how the entity that created nature has a lot more resources and a lot more influence in the larger scheme of things. As we drove along Marine Drive, it was interesting to watch it change from a rough forestry road to a municipal paved road lined with signs, houses and pruned and trimmed lawns and shrubs. </p>

<p>I went to my place and had a good nap, my cats sleeping on top and beside me. They quite evidently missed me as much as I missed them. Later, I cleaned myself up a little and went down the hill to James’ place to have some grub. </p>

	     <p><b>July 7, 2015</b></p>

<p>James wanted to take his daughter kayaking, but we realized we couldn’t go anywhere too remote. We opted for Cluxewe Resort, just a turn and a short drive off Highway 19. If you are travelling from the south, it is 12.2 kilometres north of Port McNeill, and then a turn to the right. There is a big Cluxewe Resort sign at the turn off, so it is hard to miss. </p>

<p>I stayed with the cats the night before and got a lot of cleaning and garden watering done. I watered everything: the flowers in front, the pots, and the vegetable garden. I even left the hose on mist for a good long time in strategic places like the zucchini planter, the blueberries, the rhubarb, etc. Except between the hours of 12 and 4, I was watering all day and well into the night with the misting hose. You’d think I was living in the desert instead of the rainforest! It’s getting to be that way, little by little. It was a good thing I put down some grass clipping mulch to hold in the moisture. I left the balcony for the morning, did my house-sitting job and then went down to James’ place. We hit the road, James in my truck with the two kayaks, and I in the Camry with his daughter, Tyra, and her friend in the back connected to their media devices. As we drove along, I met a very slow logging truck, a bear (which the girls didn’t see because they were in that other “media dimension”) and a mama deer and her two babies. The baby Bambis hooves were proportionally larger than their growing bodies. Running away from the car they were leaping awkwardly, looking not quite as graceful as Mama. I couldn’t help but think they looked like kids trying to move fast in their mother’s oversized high heel shoes.  </p>

<p>We went to the campsite we reserved but we weren’t happy with it. It was narrow, with not much greenery and lots of traffic driving by to the islet. James took the bike and went on a tour around half the campsite. When he returned, we took the car to the islet and checked out some other camping spots. We really liked 54, but wrote down some other numbers just in case. When we got to the office, we found out 54 was reserved starting tomorrow until September! We ended up in 100, just across from 54. When we were unloading at site 100, I wasn’t much help, as I had trouble sleeping the night before. I did my usual duty, and set up the tent and the air mattress. Once that was done, I collapsed onto the air mattress and slept for a good part of the afternoon. 
James woke me up and put the end of Chloe’s leash in my hand so he and the girls could go kayaking. Though I was barely awake, I noticed that the particular sound of the waves meant they were getting rough. I got up and had a couple of iced teas in my folding chair with Chloe on my lap, struggling to get myself fully awake. When I finally got up to go to the bathroom, James was coming down the road. He told me their trip was cut short by the waves (tell me something I didn’t know!). They had some trouble coming in with the surf and Tyra ended up getting splashed. At first Tyra wanted to go to the lighthouse, but James vetoed it. They said they had fun bobbing up and down, but they didn’t feel like kayaking for very long. It seems like the girls had fun, but got bored with kayaking pretty quickly. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post8-cluxewe/tyra.jpg" alt="Cluxewe"><em>Tyra</em></p>

<p>In the evening, we grilled steaks on the BBQ because there was a fire ban. I complained that we did not have lemon juice and olive oil for the grilled vegis. I’m very persnickety about following recipes to the letter. James often makes fun of me because I won’t go “outside the box” when I cook. I often answer back that I go “outside the box” in just about every other aspect of my life, so I’m allowed. I went toward the office to see if there was a store, but there was only a restaurant. James offered me some olive oil based margarine and butter and I took it, but we couldn’t find a substitute for lemon juice. I was having a crisis! I was so bothered by not having lemon juice, I ended up going to Port McNeill the next day to get it and a few other things.  </p>

<p>James and I went for a bike ride around the campsite, then followed a path into the woods that lead us to the river, a huge pile of water worn rocks and a trail on the beach. We parked our bikes and sat on a log for a while, watching the scenery and musing. We went walking along the beach for as long as my knee could stand it. I thought of Hawaii and how it is very much like this, exotic, but just a lot warmer. James expressed a wistful desire to go to Hawaii someday. I wasn’t interested in Hawaii at first, because I thought it was probably too touristy. When I got there though, after spending a winter in China and Hong Kong, I was actually impressed. I stayed there a couple of months in ‘83, living in a Philipino lady’s apartment with a Swiss roommate and a whole lot of cockroaches. One of those cockroaches was nearly the size of my hand and had sneaked into my bikini bottoms when they were hanging to dry on the closet pole. It gave me quite the scare when I gathered my stuff for a day of snorkeling at Hanauma Bay!
With no campfire to sit around because of the fire ban, I asked the girls if they would be interested in playing poker. They didn’t know how, so I offered to teach them. I first taught them the hands, from lowest to highest, then we played a few practice rounds. We then we had a rousing game well into the night, our table lit with several battery-operated lanterns. </p>

<p>After we finished the game, James and I retired to our tent. As soon as we were in, the girls pulled the poker chips out again and started playing between themselves. While James and I were reading by flashlight, we had to shout out the answer to the occasional poker related question. </p>

<p><b>July 8, 2015</b></p>

<p>We got up around 10, expecting the girls to follow suit not long after…but no such luck. In fact, when we came back from our kayaking trip that day, they were still asleep! I forgot what teenagers were like! 
The other times we kayaked, Chloe whined a lot on the water. This time, however, she whined to get <i>into</i> the kayak! She didn’t whine at all when we were on the water! She is probably so used to kayaking now, that she would probably feel lost without it. It would be much harder for her to stay home alone all day with only a couple of visits from a dog-sitter. Even though she is well into middle age, she is very much a baby at heart and has to go everywhere with Mommy and Daddy! </p>

<p>Following the tide going out, James and I kayaked close to shore in the direction of the estuary. We paddled in the fog, feeling calm, and not inclined to paddle too hard. The estuary water was very shallow. We realized we weren’t going to get too far in at low tide. We decided instead to paddle into the fog, staying close to the shore so as not to get lost and inadvertently paddle out to sea. It’s quite a mystical experience, paddling in the fog. It felt like we were in a bubble, and it was so quiet. We came across a reef of rocks and realized we had to go around. We ran into a kelp bed and a community of rocks encrusted with barnacles. We spent some time paddling around them, snapping pictures of rocks, barnacles and each other.  </p>

<p>Seeing a lot of driftwood on the shore, James and I debated what it was all about. James thought they were man made structures and I disagreed. We paddled there to see who was right, and it turned out James was. Someone had piled driftwood into crude shelters. We landed to check things out. Chloe was excited about the structures, hopping around and energetically sniffing in and around them. We walked down the beach, noticing deer, wolf and even Chihuahua tracks in the sand! We commented that Chloe has gotten a lot stronger and healthier since she started kayaking (even though she doesn’t paddle) and is in much better spirits these days. She gets more exercise, and a lot more varied and interesting things to sniff. We determined that we definitely have to camp here some day. </p>

<p>James mentioned that we should have brought a snack and should always bring a snack. We thought we were only going to go to the estuary, but it didn’t turn out that way. We admitted we always end up going a lot further than we expect. It was resolved from that day forward that we will always bring a snack when we kayak, no matter where we think we are going. It’s a big deal, because it is very hard to paddle hungry.<br>
On the return trip, we found that the ebbing tide had changed the scenery. There were more rocks than before. The rocky reefs were bigger too, forcing us take longer detours into the centre of the bay. We met two other kayakers on the water—which is a first for us. You would think there would be more kayaking traffic on the North Island in general, but there isn’t. We exchanged our delight in seeing other kayakers. We asked them if they could suggest some good kayaking spots.  Many that they had suggested we had already been to. They also suggested that the south end of Nimpkish Lake and Huson Caves were a must. We eventually did go to Huson Caves in 2016, and the verdict is a definite “yes.” At Nimpkish Lake, however, though the scenery was stunningly beautiful and I was able to take some great photographs, it is not a good place for kayaking. It is a very long lake, making it a wind tunnel with plenty of rough water. Nimpkish Lake is more of hangout for windsurfers and parasailers. It is also good place to camp on the beach. 
Our campsite appeared out of the fog sooner than expected. The fog and the calm water made us lose our sense of time. The shoreline was much longer than it was when we left it, which probably also helped to shorten the trip. We were having a struggle carrying our kayaks up the now significantly larger shore. We thought to alternate carrying them, but, in the end we gave up and decided to leave them where they were, halfway up the shore, as the tide would probably not reach them before the next time we went kayaking. </p>

<p>We had a much needed quick lunch of smokies because we were <i>really</i> hungry! After lunch, James took the girls kayaking while I stayed behind with Chloe and wrote my reflections on my laptop until I got sleepy and had to have a nap. They were not gone too long. When the bunch came back, James told me of some of the unusual ideas they had. Tyra said she wanted to jump in the water and swim! She also kept bugging him about the lighthouse, which he considered out of the question. Then they said they were getting too hot and wanted to come in. I don’t think our 10 or 12 kilometre treks would be these girls’ cup of tea!  </p>

<p>James and I went out on the kayaks again at around 6 pm, when the estuary was at high tide. The fog had cleared and the water was fairly calm, with a few breakers at the shore. Even though we were only planning to do the estuary, we still packed a lunch as per our previous pact. Just as we got to the beach, James got a funny look in his eye. He looked around at the water, turned to me and said, “How ‘bout we try it?” At first, I didn’t understand what he was talking about. “Try what?” I asked. He didn’t answer me right away, as if he was expecting me to read his mind. It turned out he was meaning paddling to the lighthouse! I was taken aback, as he had been telling me and the girls all weekend that the lighthouse was off limits. I realized that it would be somewhat of a trepidatious paddle, but said a hesitant “OK.” I am a sucker for lighthouses! It would turn out to be a lot more than we bargained for! </p>

<p>We had a clumsy launch. I tried to go out onto the water on my own and ended up getting splashed. I had taken out the rim around my cockpit when I set myself inside and, in the hesitation, got my splashes. I jumped out and James fixed my cockpit.  He told me to jump in quickly, and then he gave me a push out onto the water. We met with huge swells that lifted us way up and brought us way down at regular intervals. It felt a little like being on a ferris wheel. James seemed to be keeping his cool, but I was freakin’. It was especially scary on the Eskia, because it was a much lighter craft. We paddled steady, carefully— no speeding or sudden moves. It was not just water, it was ocean, very deep and full of powerful currents in this narrow passage called the Broughton Strait, and I was one tip away from being in it! Getting capsized in this water would be very dangerous indeed—there is no telling where the currents would take us! I set aside my apprehension and just kept my mind on getting to the lighthouse. We were going at a moderate speed and only took a half an hour to get across, but it seemed like it took much much longer! When we got close to the lighthouse, we were salivating for that solid shoreline! </p>

<p>Grabbing James’ camera right away, I snapped shots of the lighthouse and the view around. In the back of my mind I was still thinking about the journey back and if I had the stomach for it, but I was savouring my time there. I got James to take several pictures of me with the lighthouse in the background. As he was taking one, he accidentally snapped a selfie and Chloe just happened to join in!  The pictures of me didn’t turn out so well, but that selfie turned out to be a gem! No one came to greet us from the buildings, but we couldn’t be too sure there was no one there. We just stayed on the shoreline, presuming it would be trespassing if we went up to the buildings. Shorelines are public domain. </p>

<p>As we had lunch, I noticed waves curling around a point. We later took a video of it, and a few photos of a big stump. Looking to the mountain range to the west, we saw a mountain top that had a shape of an indigenous chief laying on his back. It reminded me of a peak at Ironstone Lookout that the residents of Crowsnest Pass coined “Mt. Mulrooney” that looks very much like an exaggerated profile of our 18th prime minister. I also thought of the ape face at Raspberry Ridge, in Kananaskis Country by Turner Valley. When the sun is at a certain position in the sky on a sunny mid-summer day, it casts shadows on the Continental Divide producing the face of a giant ape. </p>

<p>For the trip back to the campsite, we switched kayaks. James gave me a lecture about points, that we should avoid them because they have dangerous currents. A fishing boat was passing by and James told me we had to stay back and let it pass. After it passed, he instructed me to steer straight into the waves, in case they might end up being rollers. They ended up being not that bad. I was feeling better in the Manitou because it was much more stable in the water. Chloe poked her nose out the cockpit in the beginning and sniffed, then hid herself in the cuddy for the rest of the voyage. I instinctively tried to make a B-line for the campsite, but it turned out to be the wrong plan. James actually started complaining vociferously—which is unusual for him. Because of the wind and the tide still coming in, he told me to point myself toward the estuary, which was north, even though we were trying to go <i>west</i>, to the campsite. Even though we were paddling like crazy to the north, we never passed the line between the campsite and the lighthouse! We just gradually drifted sideways, getting closer and closer to the campsite! It was an odd experience to say the least. Under these conditions, if I had been leading the way, we would have ended up further south in Port McNeill! It is amazing that tides, wind and currents can make such a difference!</p>

<p>As we got closer to shore, James devised a plan for landing. We were to head north of the campsite a bit and then drift into shore at a south-westerly angle, getting a boost from the waves. He ordered me to ride the waves and then start back paddling when I catch a surf. I’m not sure if I really understood his instructions at the time, but somehow, I seemed to have instinctively done the right thing. Mind you, I spent some time in Hawaii riding surfs, so maybe that experience came in handy. I jumped out quickly and hardly got splashed at all. </p>

<p>We were greeted by some onlookers who had watched our landing and were intrigued by our kayaking Chihuahua—especially 3 little boys in shark helmets. When I took Chloe out of the kayak, she seemed to be stuck in my arms, not wanting to be let down. I had to carry the kayak while holding her. I put Chloe on a log to socialize with the boys, while James and I answered grown ups questions about what it was like to kayak with a Chihuahua. When Chloe was done with the PR, she faced both James and me, then looked to me to pick her up. James commented, “You want mommy.” I guess when one has been through a harrowing experience, it’s mommy that they need! Once we were done tying up the kayaks, James emphatically told me he was done kayaking for the day. Later he confessed to me that that trip gave him cause to pause, which says a lot! He doesn’t get scared easily, let alone admit it! We considered kayaking the estuary later that evening, but we were unable to get up the gumption. </p>

<p>That night, after I drove to Port McNeill to get (compulsively) needed ingredients and a few treats like chips and pop, we grilled vegetables on our propane grill. James had the left over steak. To the girls, who seemed to not need food, I gave some cheese and crackers and cucumbers that they barely picked at. They had been playing poker most of the day and wanted us to join them. After we had supper, made coffee and cleaned up, we played poker by the music from the girls’ cell phones until we started yawning. The winner of the all in hand was Tyra’s friend, even though Tyra and James tended to be the winners most of the time. Late at night, we marvelled at the brightness of the stars and how many would could see. We could easily discern the band of the Milky Way. </p>

<p><b>July 9, 2015</b></p>

<p>James and I planned to get up for 8 am to take the high tide into the estuary. We woke up at 7 am, discussing it and checking the tide guide, but fell back into our beds and slept some more. At about 8, I again asked James if he wanted to get up to do the estuary, but he brushed me off saying he wanted to sleep. Later he was angry at himself for not getting up. James ended up getting up around 10:30 and I, 11:30. As we had our breakfast and packed up the vehicles, he kept beating himself up for not getting up in time to paddle the estuary. </p>

<p>You win some. You lose some. </p>
