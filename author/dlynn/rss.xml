	     <p><b>June 21, 2015</b></p>

<p>We were discussing the various possibilities for kayaking, and wanted to leave some of the best stuff for a visit from James’s daughter and/or my son.  On this day we settled on few hours of kayaking on Neroutsos Inlet, which included the Frigon Islands and the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Some of you might be wondering about the names of our inlet and the islands in them.  Yes, “Neroutsos” does sound a lot like the psychological disorder and Frigon sounds like a substitute swear word.  Back in the seventies, when the mill dumped pollution into the inlet indiscriminately (before they seriously cleaned up their act because of new government regulations), people who were opposed to it would call it, “Neurosis Inlet.”  Well, the name “neurosis” seems to have stuck.  When I came here in 2010, practically anyone I’ve talked to has pronounced the name like the psychological disorder.  If you look closely at the name “Neroutsos” and follow the rules of English pronunciation, it should sound a little different.  It doesn’t flow smoothly off the tongue, however, which is probably why people tend to default to “neurosis.”</p>

<p>The name “Neroutsos” actually has a very honourable origin.  It was the name of a hardy and heroic big wig and pioneer in the development of navigation in western coastal waters, Captain Cyril Demitrius Neroutsos.  Born into a wealthy shipping family in 1868 in Bowden, Cheshire, England, his considerable metal was soon tested when he became an orphan at age 13.  With barely any time to grieve his circumstances, he set out on the high seas as an officer cadet.  In addition to trade excursions around the globe, he ended up participating in the New Zealand to London clipper ship races around the Cape.  By the time he reached 18, he had sailed around the world four times!  With the arrival of steam, Neroutsos acquired his papers for deep sea master and signed on with the <i>British India Steam Navigation Company</i>.   This brought him to Seattle during the Klondike Gold Rush where he became marine superintendent for the <i>Frank Waterhouse Company</i>.  In 1901, he switched over to the <i>Canadian Pacific Navigation Company</i> ;and, because of his qualification as a lieutenant Commander in the <i>Royal Naval Reserve</i>&gt;, he was promoted from marine superintendent to Manager of the costal fleet.   Although his knowledge of the deep seas was impeccable, he signed on as a mate on the <i> S.S. Islander</i> in order to gain more familiarity with coastal waters.  While he was asleep in his quarters, the ship struck an iceberg off the shores of Alaska and sank in 20 minutes.  As soon as the ship struck, Neroutsos went knocking on cabin doors, waking up passengers and assisting people onto the deck.  The last man off the deck before the ship disappeared into the sea, he continued his heroic feats in the water.  A strong swimmer and apparently impervious to the frigid Alaska water (I can’t even handle the water down here in the middle of the summer!) he helped save a man with an injured leg by lifting him onto a door from the wreckage.  Incredibly, he stayed afloat in the water until help arrived!  When he was found, Neroutsos was hypothermic, but holding an unconscious girl on his shoulders who survived because of his efforts.  There were many causalties from the sinking.  Neroutsos was the only executive officer to survive.</p>

<p>Despite this legendary account, Neroutsos is remembered because he was able to make sweeping advancements in coastal navigation in a single lifetime, keeping people as safe as possible in the relatively uncharted waters of the New World.  </p>

<p>Ed Frigon, after whom our islands are named, was another unbeatable North Island pioneer.  Hailing from Maurice Quebec, he set out to make it big in the California Gold Rush of the 1850s.  When things did not go his way there, he set his compass for a life of adventure in the Pacific Northwest.  After working a few years in Victoria to save money, he chartered a sealing schooner for Hope Island (Bull Harbour) in 1857.  He spent 32 years running a fur trading post for local First Nations and passing sealing and whaling ships.  In 1895, he moved to Limestone Island, now called Drake Island, in the Quatsino area.  This is the island that we saw on our paddle from Atkin’s Cove.  It is interesting to think that this lonely looking uninhabited island was once a happening place!  In Quiet Cove (now called Pamphlet Cove), in the middle of the Island, Frigon opened a trading post, a floating wharf and a three storey hotel with fourteen rooms and a saloon!  The hotel ran for 8 years before it was shut down mainly because of prohibition in 1917.  An elderly Ed Frigon then moved to a large homestead north of Port Alice to spend his remaining days with his late in life love interest First Nations woman and “Last of the Longheads,” Lucy Moon, who was about 50 years his junior.  </p>

<p>Frigon was only 5’2”, but he was strong as an ox, with a personality to suit.  A true pioneer, he chose to live in a remote part of the world where there were very few white people, and probably not a single Francophone!  Not only did he survive life in the wilderness but he found a way to make a living, giving commerce on the North Island a serious jump start in the process.  He was so much the heartbeat of commercial life of the community that his influence continued even after he passed away.  A general store in Quatsino that opened shortly after his death was named after him.  Lucy Moon remained living on Frigon’s property, and, after teaming up with Nip Wong, worked Frigon’s land and  supplied Port Alice with fresh produce for many years.  Frigon’s hotel was floated down to the old Port Alice townsite and renamed “Jones’s Hotel” and used for housing mill workers.  It was also used as a community dance hall that was probably the starting point of many Port Alice romances.  The hotel was finally destroyed in the mid-1960s, along with the rest of the buildings of Old Port Alice, when the town site was moved to Rumble Beach.  Probably every transaction that happens and every child that is born on the North Island since is, in some way, touched by the ghost of Ed Frigon.  </p>

<p>We were getting pretty fast at loading and unloading the kayaks.  We launched at low tide at the Marina, but not at the boat dock because I think you have to pay.  We passed boats and a pole coated with mussels going up to the highest tide level.  We were heading in the direction of the Frigon Islands.  We passed around the north side, seeing the rocks encrusted with barnacles and plant life in a variety of hues.  When you launch at low tide, you get to see everything that lives under the water part time!  When we came around the other side we found a small cove with a pebbly beach.  We decided this was to be the place for our snack when we were ready. </p>

<p>We contemplated visiting some friends who lived across the inlet.  We had started out quite late (we slept in), so we had missed the best part of the day for paddling on calm waters.  We headed in that direction, but chickened out part way there.  We were suspecting the waves would get choppy soon from the inflow winds.   For those of you who don’t know what inflow winds are (I just learned this recently), they are produced when the mid-day heat from the inlet rises up and creates a gap for cooler winds to come rushing in from the ocean.  When the winds come rushing down the inlet, not only does it create wind resistance, it makes for higher waves, and, depending what is happening with the tides and the currents, it can make for complicated boating in general.  Neroutsos Inlet is a great place for low key kayaking, what I like to call “Chihuahua kayaking”— or family kayaking, as it is sheltered from the rough waters of the ocean by mountain ranges.  It is not like some places around Tofino that have breakers and high waves which are good for surfing and more acrobatic kayaking.  On the inlet, you only have to work around the inflow winds; but, even then, they are only a bit challenging.  You will get a good example of this later in this account.  Generally speaking, to get calm easy kayaking, you should do it in the morning.  Unfortunately, James and I are not morning people, but we’re working on it.  </p>

<p>I didn’t want to do the trip across the inlet either because we still hadn’t found a proper life jacket for Chloe.  James recently went to Campbell River to get her a life jacket and take care of some other business.  When he put it on Chloe, she didn’t look too comfortable.  He had been looking for a life jacket for her for a while with little luck.  Chloe is a small dog who is big around the middle.  Most small dog vests tend to be too small and medium sized vests fit her around the middle, but nowhere else.  We thought the tabs at the front of this latest one might be too bothersome for her small head.  James said he saw one that would be better at Bosley’s, but they didn’t have her size.  We decided to return the life jacket he bought and keep looking for a better one.  This is not easy for us, as we live two and half hours from “civilization.”  Shopping on the North Island hasn’t improved much since Ed Frigon’s time.    </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post5-friggon/lifejacket.jpg" alt="Friggon Islands"><em>The not too comfortable lifejacket.</em></p>

<p>As we paddled around we saw a prawning boat and waited until it passed us.  We were respecting the laws of the water:  little boats yield to big boats.  We then had a little fun bouncing up and down on the wake waves.  Later there came a tremendously large sailboat with the sails down.  We estimated its value at about a million.  When we launched from the marina, we saw two boats that we estimated at 200 and 300 thousand.  Such capitalists we are!  We appreciate a boat’s beauty by its possible price tag!  You have to admit that the price tag has a definite bearing on aesthetics!  It just happens to be one aspect of appreciating something than most people can relate to.  I mentioned to James that I thought this inlet should be full of such boats, as well as kayaks and canoes and such.  I think Port Alice is a mini Monaco that has not been discovered yet.</p>

<p>The water wasn’t very choppy, but we suspected it would be soon.  By the time we headed back to the Island, it was past noon and we were hungry.  As we landed, the tide was low so there was plenty of ground to walk on.  We realized that high tide would leave only a narrow grassy patch between the two islands.  It might even be completely submersed in a super high tide.  There were remnants of a campfire right on that ridge.  We contemplated how it would be fun to spend the night here, looking at the “bright lights” of Port Alice while sitting around a campfire.  There is beauty to be found in human constructions, as well as Nature’s.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post5-friggon/jamesmefrigon.jpg" alt="Friggon Islands"><em>James and me on the Frigon Islands.</em></p>

<p>We sat down and had our lunch of hummus and rice crackers, cheese and blue berries.  The crows on the Islands made quite a racket for quite some time, enough to start getting on our nerves.  I’m not sure what the issue was, whether they felt we intruding on their territory or if they were excited about possible left overs and handouts. These crows were very different from the crows in Port Alice.  The crows at the school, in particular, gather on the roof of the school at recess time, waiting in a row and quietly watching as the kids as they drop all kinds of goodies and crumbs on the ground.  When the class bell rings they know it is <i>their</i> lunch time! These crows on the Frigon Islands were a little more “wild.”  Their cawing was loud and hostile sounding.  They did settle down eventually, though.  I guess it was a different “tribe” of crows, with different customs and practices. </p>

<p>On the island, Chloe engaged herself in the doggie business of sniffing around for “doggie emails” and sending a few herself.   Animals have their own version of the internet based on scent!  After our snack, James, Chloe and I went searching for trails.  The North part of the island was quite forbidding: it was tightly closed in with very thick trees and Salal.  We found what looked like a trail opening on the south end of the island.  We pushed through the Salal to find somewhat of a clearing that would be reasonably good for pitching a tent.  We followed the very overgrown but still faintly discernible trail to the south end of the island and found a lookout perch with a rough hewnbench, another remnant of a campfire and one heck of a view!  We could see some island lumps sticking out of the water.  The view of the inlet was a high one, and we felt like we were on top of the world!  It would be wonderful to sit and stare at it in front of a campfire around twilight and then watch the stars at night without fear of running into predators.  Looking up from the lookout perch, we saw a weather worn old snag with all the crows sitting on it, by this time settled down.  I took some nice shots of them, but most had flown away before I was able to get a really good one.  I then took some nice shots of the view.  We sat for quite some time in the sun and enjoyed the view.  Chloe made herself comfortable under the bench in the shade. It was hot!  </p>

<p>Instead of going back into the brush, we went around the rocks down to the cove and back to our landing spot.  When we got back there, we discovered that the crows had cleared away our left-over crackers!   No wonder they settled down!  We went walking around the north side of the island looking for a trail in a few places but we were forced to turn back.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post5-friggon/crows.jpg" alt="Friggon Islands"><em>The crows.</em></p>

<p>There was a lot of sea asparagus on the island.  James and I quibbled on how to pick them.  I tried to pick them individually and he just pulled them up by the handfuls.  I told him to be more selective, and just pick the nice bright green juicy looking ones.  It also gives the plant a greater chance of surviving.  James joked that he was fired.  I said “Yeh, you are!” but he just kept on picking, though he did start to be more selective.  I mentioned I could consult my Chinese cookbooks and make a stir fry with them with Chinese mushrooms, fresh mushrooms and maybe black beans.  We started picking them where there was more shade, as that was where they seemed to be the greenest and juiciest.  We picked a Ziploc container full and then some, which was too bad, because we ended up forgetting them and not realizing it until we got all the way back home. </p>

<p>Worried that the tide might take our boats away, James had tied them to a big piece of driftwood.  When we arrived, the kayaks were sitting on rocks.  By the time we were getting ready to leave, they were floating and James had to pull them in.  As I was waiting for James to load up, I slowly paddled out to the mouth of the little cove and was peek-a-booed by a seal!  Its head was just above the water and it was staring at me with a child-like curiosity for some moments before it ducked out of sight.  I could definitely get a “vibe” from this seal.  Just like I can get a good idea of what someone is thinking by their facial expression and body language, I felt a short merging of minds with this seal.  It turns out, seeing us humans is as much of a novelty as seeing them is for us!  </p>

<p>James was taking a while packing up and, used to him being so efficient and thorough, I didn’t worry about the sea asparagus that I left a little too far from our gear.  We paddled around the south of the islands between the out-cropping of rocks, running into some kind of swimming grey fluffy water birds.  Then, it was on to the lighthouse!</p>

<p>Having been a lookout, I have quite an affinity for lighthouses.  I was determined to get there sometime and it looked like this was the day.  We probably should have gone there first, because, by the time we were on our way there, it was well into the afternoon and the water was starting to get rough.  We probably should have gone to the lighthouse first, <i>then</i> the islands.  The water got rougher as we got closer to the lighthouse.  I absolutely wanted a nice picture of the lighthouse, but my phone camera-- James’s old Galaxy 3--was out of battery.  There was only James’ brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that he just bought a few days ago in Campbell River that still had battery life—but he had it in his boat!  Because the water was so rough and the current kept pushing us all about, we were having trouble getting coordinated.  We were reluctant to pass the brand new phone from one kayak to the other for fear it would end up on the bottom of the inlet!   Having a couple of art degrees, I’m pretty persnickety about how to take photos.  I went to the place to show James where I wanted the picture to be taken from, but, after doing a little fiddling and looking away, the current had pushed me metres away from the desired position!  I was also scared of getting too close to the lighthouse, for fear of crashing into it and losing my balance.  It was a lot like being on a conveyor belt, with a large immobile jagged object at one end of it!  Alas, I was unsuccessful at getting my message across.  James took several photos, but they were not centred like I wanted them and probably not taken from the place that I wanted them taken. He suggested we could crop it.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/post5-friggon/frenzy_lighthouse.jpg" alt="Friggon Islands"><em>Frenzy around the lighthouse.</em></p>

<p>Between our battles with the current and the increasing choppiness of the water, we suddenly sensed an urgency to head to shore and abandon this business of getting a well-framed photograph.  We were especially nervous since Chloe did not have her life jacket yet. We were bumping up and down on the waves, which was kind of fun albeit a little nerve wracking. We tried to head to shore but didn’t seem to be getting anywhere at all!  We were aiming to head north to Jeune Landing and it was proving elusive as the current kept pushing us away from it.  Finally, frustrated, I was determined to get out of this rough water.  I said to James “race ya!” and engaged my paddling warp drive in the hopes of actually getting somewhere.  It worked and the shore finally came in sight.  James wasn’t too far behind me.  We arrived at the shore, a bit south of Jeune Landing.  The waves were still just as high as they were in the middle of the inlet and the current was still pushing us south.  That short trip would have demanded a lot of power and we were just about spent!  We gave up going to Jeune Landing and followed the shore back to the marina.  We likely got ourselves on TV when we paddled by the Brooks Bay Cable weather camera.  We complained how tired we were the whole way back, paddling slowly and meekly like we were a couple of 120-year olds (I was inclined to say 90 year olds, but I suspect that there are some 90 year olds out there who could seriously out paddle us!).  Even Chloe was looking tired, though she didn’t have to paddle.  She had emerged from her fleece and was sitting up, hot and panting, with her unusually big tongue hanging way out.  We brought our two kayaks together and poured some water into her little red bowl so she could have a drink.  </p>

<p>As is evidenced by our experience that day, boating can be pretty complicated.  Between currents, tides, weather and the position of the sun, not to mention whatever may be under the water like reefs, whales and icebergs, you have to know what is going to happen in the water at any particular time and where exactly it will happen.  Just think, our Captain Neroutsos had to have a good grasp of all these factors for the <i>entire west coast</i>—not to mention the fact that he knew this stuff for all the oceans around the world—and in a time before GPS and Google maps!  It’s hard even to imagine!  The guy definitely deserves to have an inlet named after him!   Both Neroutsos and Frigon very much deserved their honours, as they both seemed quite super human.  Now, after researching these two men, when I say “Frigon Islands on Neroutsos Inlet,” I no longer say it with a bit of a snigger, but with reverence.<br>
Once we were on shore, we discovered we were more tired than we originally thought.  My body felt like lead.  We were even too pooped to wash down the kayaks.  For the rest of the day we were virtually useless, doing minimal domestic routine like zombies, afflicted with something that only a good night’s sleep could remedy.  </p>

<p>I would like to say a special thanks to Evelyn Hartford at the Port Alice Tourist Information centre for providing me with historical information for this and future blog entries.  A lot of the history of Port Alice cannot easily be found in mainstream information sources. Thankfully, people like her are indispensable for keeping this information preserved and bringing awareness to that fact before it is forever lost to the passage of time.  </p>

<p>When I write, I try to allow “other forces” to intervene in my final product.  Perhaps it includes the subconscious mind, the collective unconscious, higher levels of awareness in the human brain, mind-controlling aliens or just plain old Mother Nature speaking through my laptop.  I just let my thoughts flow freely and worry about editing later.  Employing the technique of brainstorming, I can sometimes get little “treats” or little “coincidences” in my writing such as allusion, symbolism and multiple levels of meaning without any apparent deliberation on my part.  The theme of ‘secrets’ in my Link River account only became apparent to me when it was in the final proofing stage.  The ‘lost’ element in the Atkins Cove adventure naturally lead to a discussion of what to do if you are lost in the woods.  The theme that seems to have emerged with this account seems to be the physical forces of nature, and how they can bring about changes in our surroundings and in our lives.     </p>

<p>James had hankering for a camping trip, seemingly out of the blue.  I, however, had some business to take care of on Friday, so we settled for a short two day trip “in our backyard” (it’s so nice to have such beautiful things in our back yard) at Marble River by the Salmon Hatchery at the northern tip of Alice Lake.  For something that was “in our back yard,” the Marble River Campsite was not lacking in exoticness!  In addition to the typical Vancouver Island trees that seem to reach to the heavens, there was thick shrubbery dividing the sites and creating a feeling of coziness and privacy—not that there were many people around that we needed to block out!  There was the additional bonus of the soothing sounds of rushing water from the Marble River Rapids.  We settled into site eight, near an embankment above the river.  We were fenced in by tall coniferous trees that were spaced far enough apart to let in a good bit of sun in the middle of the day.  We had everything: sun, shade, openness, coziness, lots of trees and lots of space all at the same time.  Oddly, the centrepiece of this trip was the campsite, and how we treated it like it was our living room.   </p>

<p>On Saturday we launched into the river from the boat launch by the bridge.  We paddled leisurely on still water, enjoying the sun when it showed up from behind the clouds now and then, and talking about life.  It was around here that James “casually” mentioned something about moving in together.  We took our time dipping in and out of small coves and checking them out.  We found a tall rock face and took numerous pictures, most of which turned out bad or blurry.  I was pretty nervous about getting close to the rock face.  The water below looked very dark, cold and endless.  Paddling a little further we came close enough to point out the direction of the cabin we found on our trip to Link River.  When the wind started to pick up and the water got choppy, we reversed direction and headed back to the campsite.  We passed by one rocky island, getting some flak from some small gulls with black tipped wings.  After checking our bird book later, we believe they might have been California gulls.  Though we got a lot of noise from them, we didn’t get dive-bombed.  We suspected that that would have been the case had we tried to land (not there was much of a place to land on the steep rocky edge of the island). We checked what we thought at first was a cove, but it turned out to be an island.  As we paddled around it, we found some boaters relaxing on a make-shift dock.  Chloe gave them her most menacing bark and they all laughed.  When we landed back at the bridge, we contemplated leaving the kayaks there so we wouldn’t have to pack them all up just to drive a few metres to the campsite.  We decided against it and went through our complete routine of putting the kayaks on our vehicles, which was a good thing since it ended up that we didn’t go kayaking the next day.  </p>

<p>When we came back to camp we had smokies and my creation of a gluten free smore with bananas, chocolate and whipped cream.  I made one for myself first, as I had never made one before.  I sliced a banana in half, put chocolate in between and wrapped it in tin foil.  I kept it on the fire just long enough to melt the chocolate.  Once it was melted, I sprayed whipped cream on it and “voila”:  banana smore!  It worked, so James was willing to take a chance on one.  We later bemoaned the fact that we didn’t bring the Yahtzee game, but managed to keep chatting into the night.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/bananasmore.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>Mmm. Banana Smore!</em> </p>

<p>I was allowed to go on a field trip with the school that I work for as a lunch supervisor on Monday, but was debating whether or not to go.  We were feeling pretty cozy at Marble River.  James wouldn’t have been able to go on the school trip with me because he wasn’t staff or a parent of one of the kids that go there.  After checking out our map and finding a boat icon at the trail head, we decided to try to go to San Jo Bay on the San Josef River with our kayaks.  When I did some research the following Tuesday I found out that, because it is a tidal river, we would have to time our trip with the tides.  If not, we would have to portage a couple of times.  That wasn’t so bad, but when we later checked the website for BC Parks, we found out that dogs aren’t allowed at Cape Scott Provincial Park because of problems with wolves!  So much for that grand plan!  When we go there, Chloe is going to have to stay with a dog sitter.  </p>

<p><b>June 15, 2015</b></p>

<p>We decided to take a hiatus from kayaking and try out the Marble River Trail.  I have an arthritic knee and was worried I wouldn’t be able to do it. We thought about doing it on our bikes together, but we would have had a hard time bringing Chloe along.  She is not terribly good around bikes, and we couldn’t let her run loose in the park.  James came up with the idea that he walks with Chloe on a leash and I take the bike so as not to add undue pressure on my knee.  It was a nice idea... in theory.   </p>

<p>We walked to the entrance of the campsite and took the fork that went up to the old campsite that is not maintained.  As we walked by the sites, we saw picnic tables at various stages of sinking slowly to the ground and being consumed by moss and shrubbery.  At the most northerly end of the loop, we found a gap in the trees and guessed that this might be the trail head.  There were no signs, no nothing!  I come from Alberta where signage is quite user friendly.  It seems that when you get to the point when you are wondering if you are on the right track, a reassuring sign always seems to turn up.  Major turns and junctures are usually very clearly marked in Alberta, so you can make an informed decision before embarking in a particular direction.  In BC, however, it seems like you already have to know where you are going to get anywhere!  Once you finally figure out how to get to your destination, through trial and error, a tip from someone or incredible powers of ESP, you will find plenty of signage!  Finding the ribbon for the trail to Atkins Cove was a struggle; but, once we were finally on the trail after getting lost several times, there were ribbons everywhere, and, at a point when we really didn’t need them because we could see the water!  What good is signage if it doesn’t give guidance to the lost!  I’ve experienced a similar frustration with highway signs in BC too:  certain needed signs are too far apart or only show up when I’m past doubt and nearly at my destination.  Oddly enough, as soon as we started walking about fifty metres on what we hoped was the Marble River Trail, we not only found signage, but a huge plaque with information and history about the place!  Go figure!  </p>

<p>We walked along the first part of the trail with our heads tilted up, in awe of this forest of very tall trees.  Though they were incredibly tall, they were not very wide—speaking of their relative youth.  They were also very uniform, looking like they had been farmed.  In December of 1907 this forest had been flattened by a hurricane, the catastrophe creating space for an inordinate amount of new growth all at once.  Because of the trees’ uniformity, it felt like we were in a kind of real life diorama­—something that looks real but not quite.  There was the occasional tall huge dead cedar left standing after the hurricanes, looking very archaic and full of character alongside it’s fresher, more nubile 108 year old younger generation companions.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/108oldyung.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>James and the 108 year old youngsters.</em></p>

<p>I did pretty well on the bike at first, stopping occasionally to go up a hill or over some rough stuff.  I was somewhat amazed at the narrowness of the trail, finding it tricky to maneuver between trees and over roots.  It is definitely a bike trail for the more serious mountain biker.  A couple of times James pushed the bike up very steep parts of the trail for me (he’s quite a chivalrous guy…a real keeper!).  I ended up going down a fairly steep hill and, thanks to a root that was protruding a little too high, I did a face plant into some ferns!  James said I did it all very gracefully, by not resisting the fall.  Luckily there was some moss under the ferns to make for a soft landing.  Chloe was concerned too, running right up to me to see if I was alright.  After a while the roots seemed to be more prevalent, either because of my perceptions after the fall, or because they actually were.   James told me to leave my bike and walk the rest of the way.  I kept wondering if the trail would end before my knees did and, lo and behold, we found signs (at the end—where else!)  One pointed to Emerald Pools, 1.2 km, and the other to Bear Falls, 75 m.  It was a no-brainer so we took the path to Bear Falls, though we remained awfully curious about Emerald Pools.  Oddly enough, at the end of the day, it turned out the walk (or the walk and bike ride) was good for my knee and it hurt way less than expected.  The next day my knee felt almost normal.  We might have been able to take on Emerald Pools.  I guess it’s true, that exercise is good for arthritis.  </p>

<p>Coming up on Bear Falls we were met with a powerful noise.  The water from the Marble River roared as it cut and carved its way around the huge boulders before spilling into a wide tranquil pool lower down.  Bear Falls is a natural fish ladder:  the falls are like steps, making it a little easier for the salmon to leap up against the current.  The water was rushing so hard though, they have quite a battle to face nevertheless!  Because of this, places like Bear Falls are a popular place for bears to hang out in the fall and fatten up on fish.  At the north side of the falls is a cement fish ladder built by Western Forest Products, giving the salmon a little more of a boost for reaching their destination and helping to increase the number of salmon that get born.   </p>

<p>Not satisfied seeing it from afar, we crawled right on to the rocks, carrying Chloe.  We sat in the sun and had a little rest and a snack surrounded by roaring churning water.  James then decided it was time to jump into the pool under the falls!  At first I thought he was kidding, then, I realized, he wasn’t!  I told him he was crazy, but I knew there was little I could do to stop him.  I joked that if he starts to drown I’m going to have to leave him there, because there is no way I’m going in that frigid water.  So he jumped into the water, swimming around, hooting and hollering either in ecstasy or in pain or both as I snapped away with his phone.  Not your average 55 year old!  Well, he didn’t drown.  He came back up with a big smile on his face.  I couldn’t stop shaking my head.  He said he liked it because it made him feel alive.  He encouraged me to try it.  I said no thanks and that I’ve experienced enough pain in my life to make me feel alive.  </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/baldy.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>Look for a bald head in the water.</em> </p>

<p>We headed back, finding my bike where I left it.  By the end of the trail, I was starting to think more like a mountain biker and was riding more smoothly on the skinny trail.  It seemed by the last few hundred yards I was in my stride.  Chloe was getting pretty tired and protested several times by refusing to move any further.  We ended up having to pick her up and carry her for a ways.  James and I took turns carrying Chloe while the other rode or pushed the bike.  Chloe would then walk a little more until she staged another protest.   We realized that this 5 or 6 km hike was like a 30 km hike for someone her size.  By the end, she hardened up too, and walked the last stretch herself.  She probably sensed from us that we were at the end of the trail.  </p>

<p>We spent the rest of the evening eating smokies (it’s a good thing our normal everyday diet is low in cholesterol) and banana smores and calculating James’ numerology with a book I brought.  He’s overwhelmingly a 2 (he’s a 2 for his life path, destiny and personality number), which is about companionship and peace-making and suits him to a T!  I’m largely a 3 which is about self-expression, which makes sense being that I’m an artist and a writer.  An individualistic solitary “artsie,” I think if I wasn’t with a strong 2 like James, I’m sure there would be no hope for me at all!  James is not just committed to a relationship with me, but to the idea of relationships in general!  It’s been quite an education for me.  His mind is set up to do everything in pairs.  If he gets up to get a coffee, he always asks if I want one.  One time I got myself a coffee just for myself and got heck for it.  If he wants to go for a walk, then I should want to go for one too.  If I want to buy an ice cream cone, then he does too.  It can be a serious problem when it comes to eating though.  He would like us to eat the same food, in the same amounts and at the same frequency, except we have different metabolisms.  He can eat a zillion calories a day and not gain an ounce and I can gain weight just looking at food!  He feels very uncomfortable eating to satisfaction when he knows I have to be a little bit hungry for the better part of the day.  Very often he has refused to eat himself because I wouldn’t.  It took a few indoctrination sessions, but he’s learned to help himself to a hearty late night snack (but looking visibly uncomfortable about it) while I sip my tea and look on.  Every once in a while though, he forgets himself and tries to share!  There’s no two ways about it:  he’s a 2 through and through!   </p>

<p>As darkness fell, we started a game of chess.  James considers himself “pretty good” at chess and thought beating me would be a breeze.  He did beat me, but I <i>did</i> make him sweat.  Practically each time it was his move, he sat there frozen seemingly forever, thinking about his next move without even twitching.  He just looked like a statue, while his brain quietly calculated away like a computer.  The chess game lasted until it got very dark.  We had to bring out all the flashlights and lamps we had and arrange them around our chess board so we could see what we were doing.  </p>

<p><b>June 16, 2015</b> </p>

<p>We spent a leisurely morning just hanging out.  I was writing my recollections and James was reading the paper and his book and we were both just generally being lazy.  Such a thing is quite a novelty for me, as I am juggling several part time jobs, volunteer work and writing and illustrating a copious amount of books.  I originally came out to Port Alice hoping for a slower pace of life…it didn’t work! When it was time to go kayaking James wanted to dump just a little water on the fire.  I had to give him my little Smokey the Bear spiel.  Not too happily, he took a bucket and went down the embankment to get some water.  I had to stand my ground, because I didn’t want us to be liable for a forest fire, financially or morally.  When disasters happen like the Fort McMurray wildfires, you don’t want to be the one that started it, even if you don’t get caught!  With major forest fire disasters, however, there is always a major investigation after where no stone is left unturned.  Sooner or later, who or what caused it gets found out!  </p>

<p>Sometimes it strikes me that humans are programmed for disaster as, it turned out, Pinch Creek wasn’t the only place we ended up putting out someone else’s campfire in high or extreme hazard in 2015. In fact, we had to put a campfire left by some campers a couple of sites down from ours during this trip!  They made no attempts whatsoever to put it out and it was still producing quite a bit of smoke as they left.  Perhaps this happens because humans have an unconscious desire for drama and emotional intensity.  Maybe people are more concerned about escaping the authorities than the actual consequences of their actions.  Perhaps this happens too often simply because people don’t have enough information on how forest fires work.  Forestry ministries tend to give the public a stern message about making sure the campfire is out, sounding threatening and authoritarian and all that, without providing the nitty gritty.  I think they should appeal to people’s intelligence, rather than trigger their propensity to be defiant.  I think they would get better results with a little education, teaching people some interesting facts about fire behaviour.  Since reading my write up about forest fires in my Link River account written this past winter, James has become much more cooperative making sure the fire is completely out.  </p>

<p>We went kayaking by the salmon hatchery again under sunny skies, discovering little coves that we had missed the last time.  In another cove, Chloe’s big antennae ears perked up and we knew something was up.  Her ears directed us to a deer drinking water from the lake.  In the same cove we came across some marsh marigolds and I did a little art photography (with a camera phone!).  In another little cove, James felt himself rise up as he scraped logs underneath (or possibly a lake monster!) so we backed up and got out of there in a hurry before we ended up stuck and needing to swim (or getting eaten by the lake monster!) .   </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/marigolds3.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>Marsh Marigolds 3.</em></p>

<p>We came around to a point that had a couple of docks, one old and weather worn with a couple of holes in it, and another newly built, both of which can be seen from the Port Alice highway.  This looks like the locale for a future cabin or at least a hang-out for some campers as there was some human paraphernalia and garbage lying around.  It was decided this was our snacking spot so we landed. As I stepped out of my kayak— much more gracefully than ever before— I felt my right foot getting sucked down!  I’ve always had unusually fast reflexes that seem to really work for me in a pinch.  Without hardly thinking about it, I somehow threw my body weight forward and landed in a heap on the beach!  It was a fraction of a second of pure scariness!  James must have thought I was having a seizure!  When I told James about the quicksand he had to feel for it, the silly goose!  He confirmed my suspicions.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post4-marbleriver/jamesnchloe.jpg" alt="Marble River Hatch"><em>James and Chloe checking out the docks.</em></p>

<p>After our snack and a few pictures taken on the docks, we headed leisurely back, talking about our exes, past relationships, open-relationships, committed relationships, dysfunctional relationships and those sorts of things.  Being on kayaks in the middle of a North Island lake is a great place for in depth philosophical conversation.  </p>

<p>As we started to pack up back at the campsite, I was feeling very sad to leave.  This was such a cozy campsite.  I wouldn’t have minded spending a couple more days just “hanging out”…but we have schedules.  My kitties were probably missing me too.   I put my hand in the fire, and it was still a bit warm from the morning even though we had put quite a bit of water on it.  It shows how persistent a fire can be in hot dry weather!  James shook his head.  He begrudgingly helped me as we dumped all the remaining water we had on it, plus a couple of buckets from the river.  I shudder to think that, if I hadn’t put my hand in the fire, we would have been leaving behind a live unattended fire in extreme hazard!  The Marble River trail could have had a whole new look in 2015!    </p>

	     <p><b>June 6, 2015</b></p>

<p>This is a story about two goofballs (and one Chihuahua) who got lost again, and again, and again. Even though it was a weekday, we were eager to make use of our new kayaks.  Our first intent was to explore the inlet behind the mill.  James loaded the kayaks on both vehicles by himself while I was working at the school and we took off after.  We drove up to a dock in front of the effluent treatment holding tank; but, as soon as we got out, James nixed the plan.  He admitted that he didn’t know what he was thinking, with the wind kicking up some significant waves on the inlet.  Our next brain wave was to drive behind the mill and launch into the inlet there, hoping the mill would act as a block for the waves and produce calmer waters.  James stopped on the road to have a discussion with me about the possible futility of our efforts (the theme for the day!).  Finally we decided we should give Atkins Cove a try since it wasn’t too far out of town and it would be sheltered.  </p>

<p>We drove north along Marine Drive and made a left turn on a gravel road just past the gas station.  To help maintain the mood of “lostness” of this story, I will give you accurate directions to Atkins Cove at the end.  The first part of the trip was gravel road and I was feeling fine.  James probably told me the directions before we left, but they didn’t sink in.  I wasn’t that worried, as he seemed to know where he was going.  After we passed a short road that lead down to the shore, it made sense to me that it should have been the route to our cove.  I tried to stop James by honking and honking.   Finally, I got his attention by stopping the truck and waiting.  He finally backed up to see what had happened to me.  With the radio on and the windows closed, he couldn’t hear me.  He told me to flash my brights the next time.  He said the turnoff was 12 kilometres from town and that he was watching the odometer.  He told me his instructions from a friend were to drive past a side road with a cable across it (with a red ribbon on it which wasn’t actually red but pink) and take the next left.  </p>

<p>After our drive along Neroutsos Main with marvelous views, we turned onto a decommissioned logging road and got swallowed by trees!  It was a very overgrown road that James jokingl y called “a goat trail.” The road was firm and drivable but the branches scratched the sides of our vehicles, making an eerie screechy sound that seemed to ask, “Do you know where you are going?”  As we drove along, methinks I may have seen the elusive trail ribbon that James was looking for but missed.  Only I didn’t know that was what we were looking for!  We kept driving deeper and deeper into this jungle.  Every so often James would have to get out of his car and throw or kick rocks out of the path of his little Toyota Camry.  At a couple of spots we had to remove branches and trees from the road.  One tree was still attached to its base and no amount of pushing or pulling would get it to snap and be out of our way.  We tried to push it together with all our might, but it would just swing back to its favoured position.  We bemoaned that we had not brought a Swede saw or an axe.  It was something we did not consider because we were supposedly on a “short day trip.”  Some short day trip: it was beginning to feel like a trek into the abyss!  Unfortunately, we did not have to be in that dilemma as, as that point—we would find out later—we had passed the ribbon that marked the trail to Atkins Cove and were well on our way to nowhere!  Finally, I suggested he hold the tree as much out of the way as possible while I drive both vehicles past.  It would have been a great idea, if we had actually needed to do it!  </p>

<p>Once we passed the immovable snag, the trees seemed to squeeze even more tightly around our vehicles and we were dodging bear crap everywhere!   We came to a fork in the road.  We debated and debated which one to take, and decided to take the one to the right.  When that one turned into a dead end, we went back and took the one to the left.  At the end of it all, they were both dead ends!  “The one less travelled” and the one more travelled were both equally futile!  After all that we took a third fork which turned out to be futile as well!  Actually, the truth of the matter was that none of them were travelled at all!  Maybe they were travelled a lot once upon a time by logging trucks, but no more, except perhaps for the occasional batch of hunters on quads, and maybe…goats.  </p>

<p>On the trail to the right, the branches seemed to squeeze even more tightly around our vehicles!  They ended up swiping the foamy under the Eskia off the car.  I honked and honked to get James to stop.  In an especially thick patch of trees, we put the foamy back in place while fighting off groping branches.  Finally, we came to an open area and saw a tiny patch of water.  I climbed on top of the truck to see what I could see, but I could see little more.  With the situation seriously challenging relationship harmony, we took short walks to check things out.  We found a good place to turn our vehicles around, and drove back through the too thick trees.  I hit a bump and lost a foamy and a strap and drove quite a ways without realizing it.  James honked and honked at me to no avail.  Finally, when I noticed he wasn‘t following me, I stopped the truck and waited for my lecture on leaving the window closed and playing the radio too loud.    </p>

<p>Irritated, dejected, inclined to call it quits and go home (though I wondered if we were all that sure of the way home anymore), all three of us hopped in the truck and took that left fork, which was also a dead end, but, thankfully, a shorter one.  Then, dumb and dumber decided to go back to third road, which lead to a slightly longer road with a dead end.  With a bit of panic starting to set in we decided to call it quits and go home to get more information.  Not long after we passed the tree that wouldn’t move, I was coasting along and noticed James wasn’t following.  I put the truck in reverse and discovered that he had parked his car on a small pullout.  Like a man redeemed, he joyfully and ecstatically informed me that he had found the ribbon.  By then I wasn’t in the mood to be ecstatic about anything, but I thought I’d better not rain on his parade.  He said he noticed it because he could see water through the trees.  It made him look around and notice the ribbon.  I then informed him that I had seen that ribbon on the way in (that I didn’t know we were looking for) and it produced a chorus of moaning and groaning.  </p>

<p>He suggested we tromp through the woods to look for the cove.  I was only wearing crocs and was no longer in the mood for exploring, so James went alone.  He came back not long after, jubilantly announcing that he found a well worn trail. Though somewhat disheartened, I went along with his suggestion to take just the tandem kayak.  We both carried the Manitou to the ribbon in the trees on the road.  Just across from it was an archway of branches and leaves that framed the entrance to the trail.  If one did not have some instructions and a basic familiarity with the BC backwoods, finding this is pretty much like finding a needle in a haystack!  James jubilantly pulled the Manitou down to the shore like it was as light as a balloon.  The trail was well padded down, as it looked like it had been used by a considerable number of people pulling kayaks.  We were assured of where we were going by the numerous fluorescent ribbons tied to trees along the trail, but the trail was quite distinct as well.  </p>

<p>Arriving at our lost lagoon, we felt victorious!  Looking around, we released many sighs and “oooohs” and “ahhhs.”  I suppose what is special about Atkins Cove is its very tranquil out of the way feeling.  It is enclosed by land masses, with only a narrow exit to the inlet.  Protected from the wind, the water was serene and still.  Out in the middle of the cove were a couple of abandoned rafts from some kind of mining operation, which really didn’t mar the beauty of the peaceful secluded setting.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/atkins_cove_2.jpg" alt="atkinscove"><em>Atkin&#39;s Cove.</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/atkinscove.jpg" alt="atkinscove"><em>Me and Little Miss Big Ears.</em></p>

<p>We packed up our Manitou to give it a run with all of us in it, even though it was supposedly made to hold no more than 120 pounds in the front cockpit.  James had previously checked the Necky website and found out that the Manitou was capable of holding a total of 500 pounds.  Between the two of us, we still had about a hundred pounds of leeway.  I was a few pounds heavier, so I sat in the back and James sat in the front.  Chloe sat on some blankets between my legs in the back cockpit.  As soon as we were both in, the kayak was noticeably low in the water.  Too much tilting one way or the other would have meant a flooded cockpit and a rescue operation.  </p>

<p>Surprisingly, though the Manitou is smaller than a full fledged double kayak, we were able to paddle rhythmically without knocking paddles much.  I basically copied James’ paddling, except when I became preoccupied by Chloe’s restlessness.  Because we were two paddlers, Chloe was getting dripped on too much!  Chloe doesn’t like getting wet!  She loves going for walks in sunshine and she doesn’t mind going for walks when it’s cold; but, when it’s raining, she will go to the end of the carport and that’s it!  We end up having to pick her up and take her around a corner so she can’t see home; then, she will walk the usual route back home in the rain.  </p>

<p>We took a short trip around the point and followed the shore.  We came across a a small beach and had our snack of cheese, gluten free rice crackers for me, granola bars for James and a couple of near beers.  We offered Chloe some cheese but, amazingly, she didn’t want to eat it.  She was probably still perturbed by her uncomfortable travel accommodations. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/viewofneurosisfrompicnic.jpg" alt="view of neroutsos"><em>View of Neroutsos Inlet from our picnic spot.</em></p>

<p>Looking around from that beach we saw numerous possibilities for kayaking.  There was Drake Island with Pamphlet Cove nestled in the middle of it.  Supposedly, there are the ruins of an old hotel there.  Farther west is the Quatsino Sound and the Quatisino Provincial Park.  To the north, around Evenson Point, is the remote village of Quatsino.  To the east of there is Hecate Cove, Marble River Provincial Park and the Quatsino Straight.   As kayakers, we had our work cut out for us!   Atkins Cove is a good launch point for travelling to these areas as; otherwise, you would have to spend all day paddling down the Neroutsos Inlet.  Because of inflow winds, the inlet most often gets choppy in the afternoon.  </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/darkisland.jpg" alt="Drake Island"><em>View of Drake Island in the evening light.</em></p>

<p>Getting lost used up a lot of time.  The sun was starting to set.  We had to cut our kayak trip short and head back around the point.  At the first part of the journey, Chloe wasn’t getting too wet, thanks to her fleece blanket.  Towards the end though, the fleece was soaked.  She tried to hide herself in the covered area between two cockpits, but that didn’t work very well either.  She came out of the cockpit and peered over the edge of the boat, looking like she was ready to jump.  I ended up leaving the paddling to James while I held her in my arms.  </p>

<p>As we came close to the shore where we launched, James paddled slowly, trying to stretch out this usually short kayaking trip. We checked out the mining rafts in Atkins, trying to picture how the operation worked.  Just before getting to our landing spot, we heard rushing water behind some willows.  We were wondering if it was something like the Disappearing Waterfall that is in another part of this area, but it turned out to be only a stream hidden in the trees.  When we figured it out, we had to untangle our paddles from some water vegetation.  We then slowly and reluctantly drifted back to our launch point.  Even though it was still quite light in the cove itself, it was feeling like night on the trail.  James pulled the kayak back up by himself.  By the time he got to the top, he was definitely huffing and puffing.  It was a lot different going up!  I had offered to help; however, he wanted to sprint hard and fast.  I have an arthritic knee and it would have made the going too slow for Mr. Fast Twitch Muscle Sprinter Guy.  </p>

<p>As we loaded up, James spent quite a bit of time swearing at himself for missing the ribbon.  James can be pretty hard on himself sometimes so that I often have to say to him, “It’s OK to make mistakes.”  Heck, if people didn’t make mistakes, I wouldn’t be able to entertain you with a silly story like this one!  Besides, the heightened emotion brought on by our misadventures, made this a very memorable trip.  I now look back on it with a little bit of nostalgia.  It really was an adventure because of the many unknowns, even though Atkins Cove should have otherwise been a very tame trip.  </p>

<p>On the gravel road part I saw a black bear picking salmon berries before it ran away.  James missed it because he was a bit behind me.  </p>

<p>When we got back to my place, the people who gave James instructions how to get to Atkins Cove passed by (speak of the devil) while I was watering the garden and James was washing the kayaks.  They admitted they got lost for a while too.  James stopped beating himself up after that.  </p>

<p><b><i>So What Have We Learned?</b></i></p>

<p>So what have we learned from this?  First of all, the value of proper planning and preparedness!  Have at least a couple of maps or more.  Especially when it comes to logging roads, as there can be inaccuracies and even major discrepancies.  Several times we encountered roads that weren’t on the map, roads on the map that weren’t there and roads in the wrong places.  Plan your trip as accurately as you can.  Discuss it in depth and check and double check your instructions.  Be willing to question instructions, maps and yourself.  </p>

<p>Second, make sure all adult members of your party know where they are going and how to get there.  There may be some confusion as how to interpret directions from any source.  The more everybody knows the better.  </p>

<p>Third, tell someone where you are going and when you plan to be back.  The movie 127 Hours is a good example of what can go wrong if you don’t.  It is about how Aaron Ralston went hiking in the canyons of Utah one day without telling anybody.  He ended up trapped in a crevice by a rock that landed on his arm.  Since no one knew of his whereabouts, or even that he was gone, he ended up having to amputate his own arm with a dull instrument in order to get help.  Normally, our cat sitter is the one who knows where we are going and when we plan to be back.  When we went to Atkins Cove “on the fly,” however, we were only planning to be gone for the afternoon and didn’t need a cat sitter.  No one had any idea of where we went, or even that we were gone!  </p>

<p>Fourth, make sure you have extra provisions:  food, water, proper clothing, proper foot ware, a first aid kit, matches, blankets, etc. in case you are stuck somewhere longer than expected.  </p>

<p>Fifth, if you are genuinely lost, a good way to get found is to start a campfire in the middle of the day.  When I was a forest fire lookout, I reported a good number of fires that ended up being just some campers having a wiener roast.  If you have a good sized fire, the column can go up pretty high and be seen for many kilometres by a fire lookout or a passing aircraft or even a member of the public on the ground.  There are lookouts all over Alberta, so that there is really not much area that can’t be seen by someone in the summer.  There are a handful of active lookouts in BC, about twenty (at one time there was 320!); but, there is a lot going on in the air and on the ground.  The forests of BC and Alberta are interspersed with industry, including logging, fire-fighting, oil and gas and mining operations,   aviation, shipping, farming, tourism and so on.  It is probably similar in other provinces.   There are people everywhere!  In the “wilderness” they are just spaced farther apart.  Be wary, though, about starting a fire in extreme hazard or during a fire ban.  For one thing, your bones could end up being tinder sticks; and, for another, you could be sued millions of dollars for the cost of fighting a fire you started.  I would rather be stuck a few more days in the bush than have to deal with either of those two problems.  I’d avoid starting a fire in windy conditions.  I’ve seen many a small fire grow to an enormous size in high or even moderate winds.  </p>

<p>I read the kid’s book <i>Hatchet</i> by Gary Paulsen some years back.  It was an enjoyable read about a teenager lost in the bush.  Although time has faded my recollection of the events in the book, I remember thinking that the only thing this kid has to do is to light a small bonfire in the middle of the day and his rescue probably would have been instantaneous!  Some lady in a lookout tower or a pilot would have been obliged to report it as a possible forest fire.  It would have to be investigated—and—the lost is found!   Hikers and hunters usually light their campfires in the evening, so, if a fire is burning in the middle of the day outside a designated camping area, it is more likely presumed to be a forest fire…and forest fires get a lot of attention!  There are even forest fire fighting operations in the Northwest Territories, the Yukon and Nunavut!  Practically every square kilometer of bush in Canada is monitored, patrolled or checked on at some point in the summer!  You are never really alone!  If you are lost in the bush and think the only thing you are going to meet is your maker, you are probably blowing the situation out of proportion.  </p>

<p>Sixth, trust your gut.  If you are going down a path and you are overcome by a feeling that something is very wrong, trust it.  In some cases, your guts might be the only thing you have to go on, as the back roads of BC are confusing and not well marked.  Our guts told us to give up and go back home, and that’s how we found Atkins Cove.  </p>

<p><b><i>How to Get to Atkins Cove</b></i></p>

<p>On Valentine’s Day 2016, we took a trip out to Atkins Cove to make sure our directions were clear.  A lot had changed.  The road had been cleared.  We later found out that a group of people are clearing trails as part of Port Alice’s new tourist initiative.  James has recently signed up to be part of this group.  We even found a kayak trail going down to Kokwina Cove on the opposite side of Atkins, which makes a more direct kayak route to the village of Quatsino and Drake Island.  You can even access the Quatsino Narrows from there, if you are willing to brave them, to get to Rupert Arm and Holberg Inlet.  To kayak the Quatsino Narrows you have to time the tides just right or it could be very hazardous indeed, and you should definitely not do it with a Chihuahua!   The Quatsino Narrows are very “narrow” (hence the name), and, when massive amounts of tidal waters pass through them, it can make for a lot of turbulence.  It is through that narrow passage that enough water has to pass through to fill up and empty two huge inlets!  The Quatsino Narrows is a trip for an experienced kayaker only, though James keeps suggesting we do them some day.  We’ll see.  </p>

<p>To get to Atkins Cove you have to get on the Neroutsos Main, which is a logging road running north and south along the east side of Neroutsos Inlet.  There are three roads that lead to the Neroutsos Main:  one starts from the highway, the other starts just a little past the gas station, and another goes through the community of Jeune Landing (pronounced “June Landing” here).  Whichever one you take will eventually lead you to a wooden bridge at the start of Neroutsos Main.  If the bridge is kilometre zero, it is a total of 11 kilometres to the pull out at the head of the trail to Atkins Cove.  As you drive, you will soon notice a fork in the road that goes up to the right.  This is Quarry Main.  Don’t take it if you want to get to Atkins Cove.  It will not lead you to Atkins Cove, but it will lead you up to a beautiful lookout point higher up the mountain that you might want to check out another time.  This is how I got the pictures of Neroutsos Inlet and Quatsino Sound for my introduction.  You can make it up there most of the way with a two-wheel drive to a nice picnic spot.  Only the very last part, to another picnic spot, you will need a four wheel drive.  After passing the fork to Quarry Main, you will drive past the Quatsino log sort, which is a rather interesting sight to behold with heavy machinery and piles of logs in gentle hues of deep brown.  You may want to stop your vehicle just to spend some time looking at it.</p>

<p>Keep going on the Neroutsos main for 9.8 kilometres.  About halfway to Atkins Cove you will pass a picnic spot with a good lookout point and an odd plaque screwed to tree stump. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post3-atkins/weirdplaque.jpg" alt="Weird Plaque"><em>Weird plaque.</em></p>

<p>When you get to 9.8 kilometres, you should be able to look back over your shoulder down to the left and see an overgrown road with a cable tied across it.  There are several pink ribbons hanging from the cable.  The turn off is the next left after this one, about 50 metres ahead.  We found a “crew working” sign at the turnoff and much of the vegetation that squeezed around our vehicles was all cleared.  There is still a pink ribbon at the head of the trail down to Atkins Cove.   Another kayak trail head to Kokwina Cove is about 200 metres north of the Atkins Cove pull out, but it is not, as yet, marked (we didn’t have fluorescent ribbon with us).  You could deposit your kayaks at the head of the Kokwina Cove trail, kayak around Evenson Point and land in Atkins Cove for a little round trip.  For an overnight trip, you might want to include Drake Island and the village of Quatsino.  Just be careful around Quattische Island that is on the west side of Kokwina, as the waters get narrow enough to cause complications.  That area is actually part of the Quatsino Narrows.  You would have to time the tides to do it safely.  I suggest that you consult The BC Coast Explorer and marine trail guide, vol. 1,  by John Kimantas— probably the most thorough Vancouver Island kayaking guide you can get—to find out exactly how to go about it.  If you want to play it safe, you should probably take the Atkins Cove side.  </p>

	  <title>Link River: Secrets of the Forest Revealed</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>For our first official kayaking trip, we decided on Link River and Alice Lake.     Because they were familiar and close to home, we thought they would be a not-so-terrifying option for our first time.  A hop, skip and a jump from Port Alice, Link River is a very short shallow rocky river joining Victoria Lake and Alice Lake.  Of the two lakes, Alice Lake is smaller.  Not only that, but, according to local folklore, Victoria Lake is rumoured to be “bottomless” (or close to it) and we thought that it might be a bit too adventurous for beginning kayakers.  The Link River campsite, with the river to the south joining into Alice Lake to the east, has very tall coniferous trees and a forest floor covered with ferns, giving it all the brooding exoticness of an Emily Carr painting. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post2-linkriver/linkriverstart.jpg" alt="Link River, here we go"><em>Unloading the Eskia.</em></p>

<p><b>May 28, 2015</b> </p>

<p>We were concerned about the campsite filling up so we went down to set up camp on Thursday.  James would stay there Thursday night with Chloe and I would go back home to do my lunch supervisor job on Friday and come after.   The first hurdle we had to face when kayaking for the first time was how to transport our kayaks.  We didn’t have the money to buy fancy dancy kayak carriers, so we were forced to improvise.  A while ago we bought some foam supports at Canadian Tire that were suggested to us by a fellow kayaker.  They are basically a couple of pieces of foam that you stick on the top of your vehicle for the kayak to sit on.  Once it is all strapped in place, the kayak is fairly secure.  They are cheap, are not a permanent solution, but work in a pinch.  We didn’t think they would work for the truck (but we eventually found out, they did), so we were trying to come up with an alternative. </p>

<p>James found a real estate sandwich board sign among the junk in my carport. I was possibly saving it for selling my book at craft fairs, but hadn’t made a final decision about it yet.  I found it at our transfer station that is coined the “Port Alice Walmart.”  The transfer station has a covered give and take area, making it a great place to “shop” in Port Alice.  Especially during the time that Port Alice was a rich mill town, you could find amazing stuff there!  Not only is most of my furniture acquired from the transfer station, but many of the materials for renovating my house--drywall mud, paint, doors, etc,--has been retrieved from there.  And because I have a small house, I also had to leave a lot of stuff there to make room for the new stuff I found. </p>

<p>James anchored the sandwich board to the end of the truck box with a ratchet strap, so it could work as an extension beyond the tailgate.  After putting a couple of the foam supports onto the sandwich board, we lifted the Manitou onto it.  It was sticking way beyond our truck box, so we slanted it to the passenger’s side.  We didn’t want to knick anybody while taking any of the sharp curves on the winding Port Alice road.  We wound one strap around the bridge between the two cockpits and hinged it to the tie-down cleats near the front of the box.  I got an idea to lasso the back of the kayak with two straps and tie them to the cleats at each side of the back of the box.  James tied the nose to a cleat at the front of the truck box with super heavy string.  He secured the foamies with duct tape and, with that-- though the Manitou didn’t look very classy--it was definitely secure.  We then loaded Eskia onto the car, loaded up our camping supplies and headed down to Link River. </p>

<p>To get to Link River from any direction, you have to travel the Port Alice road, Highway 30, until you see very noticeable signs that say “Link River.”  That’s hard to miss.  Once you head east on the Link River road, it gets a little tricky, especially if you are not used to driving the back roads of BC.  You basically have to travel down logging roads to get there--but the forest is full of logging roads.  Be careful where you turn and which fork you take.  If you take the wrong road you can end up halfway to Dimension X or some other tricky place like a narrow road on the top of a mountain with no room to turn around and go down (I will tell about that experience a little later).  Link River, however, is pretty tame as forest back roads in the area go.  There are three forks in the road, but they all have “official” district signs pointing to Link River.  There are also a lot of home-made signs to help you out as well.  It’s hard for anything to go wrong.   Link River is a short drive from the highway, so if you find yourself driving for hours and hours and not getting anywhere, you took the wrong turn (we have stories like that too). </p>

<p>At this point I think I should take some time to inform you about another hazard of logging roads: logging trucks!  Logging trucks have the right of way.  That means if you run into one on a one lane dirt road you have to make room for it…even if it means driving into the ditch, that is, if there is one!  Sometimes there isn’t one, and you and your vehicle will become a pancake!   Sometimes they will stop if they can; but, the g-forces created by their loads make it difficult.  Because loggers maintain banker’s hours, a good way to avoid them is to travel after 6 pm on the week days or on weekends.  We have forestry companies to thank for the roads that lead us to our back woods adventures, so we have to respect their jurisdiction over them.  They are not so much of a concern going to Link River.  There is a lot of tourist traffic on the Link River road and the logging companies seem to make adjustments for that.  Wherever you go in the back woods, keep your eyes and your ears open, stay close to your side of the road, and keep a look out for escape routes. </p>

<p>When we arrived at Link River there was practically no one around, so we had our pick of campsites.  It was almost a problem because we took a long time checking out all the sites--which were all very beautiful—and deciding on which to use.  We finally settled on the place with a bunch of large sculptural stumps, one of which had steps carved into it.  After setting up camp, I left James and Chloe behind and went home with James’ car.  Not thinking too clearly, we traded keys so that he had my truck keys and I had his car keys.  I didn’t realize it at the time that I was giving him my house keys!  I went all the way home, drove into my carport, seeing my cat, Mr. Magoo, waiting at the door for his chow, and I couldn’t get in!  I just skipped the swearing and beating myself up part.  I apologized to Mr. Magoo, turned around and went back all the way to Link River.</p>

<p>By the time I got back to Link River, I discovered James had moved the campsite.  He said it had too much northern exposure and was too windy.  With the stumps too, it felt kind of eerie and especially damp.  When I finally got home, Mr. Magoo had given up waiting and was on another cat adventure.  I spent the evening thoroughly watering my garden, which included my vegetable garden in the back, the hydrangea garden in the front and all the potted herbs and tomatoes on my balcony.  On a hot dry day, watering all my gardens can take two hours or more.  When I came here from Alberta, I assumed that it rained here all the time and that I wouldn’t need my garden hose.  Luckily, I brought it anyway.  In Port Alice especially, we can get a good share of hot sunny weather in the summer.  I like to call Port Alice the “California of the North Island.”  After seeing James and me pack up our vehicles for camping the day before, my neighbours looked at me oddly.  I had the feeling that they thought James and I had a fight. When they asked, “how was kayaking?” I explained that we had just set up camp and that I would go there after work tomorrow.  Even when I told them that, I had the feeling they didn’t really believe me. </p>

<p>I got caught up in doing this and that, leaving a note and food out for the cat sitter, and doing some last minute watering.  By the time I made it to Link River, it was quite late in the afternoon.   Taking advantage of very calm water, James and Chloe had already kayaked across the lake to the Pinch Creek campsite.  Chloe was cool as a cucumber on her first official kayak journey, burying herself under her blankets in her little Chihuahua cockpit and napping as James paddled across the lake.  By the time I arrived, the water was choppy.  We debated about whether or not we should take it on.  We decided to just take a short trip, which ended up being not that short. </p>

<p>This wasn’t our absolute first time on kayaks.  When we were camping at Rupert Arm early in the spring, we borrowed another camper’s double kayak for a good long day.  For our second time, we took turns trying out our Eskia on Neroutsos Inlet the day we bought it.  That day, however, it was windy and miserable and raining a bit.  One thing I will always remember about that day was when James tried to cast off on the kayak still on his feet and trying to casually slip into the cockpit as he was drifting.  We now know that when you cast off in a kayak, your butt should be firmly inside!  I think I tried to mention something about that; but, in the short space of time it took to ignore me, James’ face ended up in the water!  It was April and the water must have been very cold to fall into! </p>

<p>Had we not known any better, we probably would have said this was a pretty hard paddle.  These days, we tend to avoid kayaking when the water is that rough, if we can.  The waves were nearly a foot high, and we could only manage by cutting straight through them.   Luckily, because James grew up and lived on the Island most of his life, he knew that much.   I threw myself into the paddling job at hand, and found myself ending up way ahead of James.  He wasn’t expecting me to be such a vigorous paddler, perhaps being that I was an old lady and all!  Actually, neither was I!  He kept wondering when I would tire out, as I seemed to go on and on like the Energizer bunny.  We then got into a conversation about “sprinters” vs. “marathoners.”  James has always been fast on his feet; he’s the sprinter.  Even today, he can run a lot faster than many thirty year olds.  I, on the other hand, am not fast, but I can go at a constant steady pace for long distances.  I won ribbons for long distance running in high school and I participated in a couple of 200 km MS bike marathons in Alberta when I was in my thirties.  James introduced me to the idea of “fast twitch” and “slow twitch” muscles.  People who have fast twitch muscles, like James, can produce a lot of power in a short space of time.  My muscles likely twitch more slowly, which allow me to go on longer at a steady pace.  I’ve always been fair to middling when it comes to sports and track and field.  We realized, however, that if I had been introduced to paddling young enough and had had the right opportunities, I might have been able to dream of going into the Olympics.  Instead, I am now a geriatric paddler writing a blog!  Can’t complain.  Paddling is paddling. </p>

<p>I’m much more graceful at getting in and out of the kayak now, but, then, I struggled to get out.  James always had to help me those first times and I probably moved in ways that were very unladylike.  For James, it must have seemed very much like helping an ox out of a kayak!  Getting in and out of the kayak is a skill that requires some practice.  The most common way to do it is to straddle the kayak, lean forward and engage your stomach muscles to get lift.  Part of my awkwardness was also due to the fact that I was a prairie chicken, unfamiliar with boating in general.  James was graceful at exiting the kayak from the start. </p>

<p>It was early evening when we came back, so it was time to start a campfire and have supper.  When it comes to making a campfire and setting up a camp kitchen, I have to sit back, snuggle with Chloe and let James have full control.  You might call him an over-aged boy scout.  As a child he was very involved in boy scouts and even went on camping trips in the winter in deep snow with his troops.  He still embodies those old boy scout values of nobility and honourability.  I’ve always had a lot of upper body strength and have been able to lift practically anything any guy my size can lift.  Though I’m in my fifties and some of my strength has waned, I can still lift a heavy object if I have to.  Being with James, however, he will quickly jump in and lift heavier objects before I do like I was some petite helpless damsel in distress!  When there is something both of us can and should lift together, he won’t give me much of a chance to help him and will move it single-handedly.  I find this state of affairs quite amusing.  I’m actually getting a little bit lazy these days, though “lazy” is not really in my DNA.  I will enjoy this situation as much as I can before he gets any the wiser. </p>

<p>James may have been lord and master of the campfire and the camp kitchen, but I provided the entertainment.  After supper, I brought out some cards and poker chips and we played until it got dark and James cleaned me out of all my poker chips.  Because I spent a few seasons working in a mountain lookout with my son, I have a lot of board and card games.  I am now a firm believer in the positive social value of games.  Too much of our entertainment these days is people sitting in front of a screen like zombies and tuning one another out.  With board and card games there is more social interaction and mental stimulation.  It’s also a great way to get to know someone you’ve just met too.  On one of our first dates I asked James for a Scrabble game and I’m sure he thought it was very peculiar.  He didn’t really see the light until sometime during the winter of 2015, when I reintroduced Scrabble during a power failure.  Sometime after that we started playing Scrabble quite regularly and one day, like a big kid, he spouted, “This is fun.” </p>

<p><b>May 29, 2015</b></p>

<p>We headed south on very calm waters in the morning, James in the Eskia and I in the Manitou with Chloe.  After we launched, Chloe realized her daddy was in the other kayak and was a little upset.  She whined and whined and tried to reach out of her cockpit towards him.  We used firm and commanding voices to make her stay put.   It wasn’t long before Chloe turned around under her fleece blanket and, protected from any rogue raindrops and splashing water, went down for her nap.  We headed south toward the Benson River.  An image that has stuck in my mind is of James gliding into a cove with cattails and giggling like a little boy.  One can go just about anywhere with a kayak!  From there we came to the mouth of the Benson River and went up a little bit until it our bottoms were scraping rocks.  After a rest break on a rocky island, we headed to Pinch Creek at the southeast end of Alice Lake. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post2-linkriver/chloeinthecattails.jpg" alt="Chloe in the Cattails"><em>Chloe in the cattails.</em></p>

<p>Arriving at the Pinch Creek campsite, we came upon a ghastly sight if you have a fire-fighting background like I do!  There was not a single person in sight, but there was a campfire smoldering away in a very high to extreme forest fire hazard!  Granted, it was amongst a bunch of boulders; however, it still had potential for disaster.  It seems there are two important things that people don’t realize when they leave a smoldering fire: the weather is fickle and dirt burns!  It may have been calm that day, but a calm day can turn into a hurricane, re-enlivening the fire and sending it into the forest canopy.  Even an increase of 30 or 40 km per hour, or a few degrees drop in relative humidity can significantly change fire behaviour.  As for dirt: the forest floor is composed of a lot of flammable things like dried leaves and twigs and the far reaching roots of nearby trees.  If some heat from a campfire reaches a root, it basically becomes a coaxial cable for combustion.  Sometime later a nearby tree can suddenly explode into flames seemingly for no reason!  Another little known fact about fires that people should know about is that if you have any heat at all, even two tiny molecules bumping together to produce half a degree of heat, it is still technically a fire!  It might die, or, it may grow.  Because of this, fires can burn without producing smoke for days, weeks, months, even years!  I’m definitely not kidding!  A fire can remain in the ground over the winter and come up the next spring!  A coal seam fire can burn for several years, even decades!  When some of that coal heat finds a crack in the ground and forest fuels, it produces smoke and reveals itself.  I’ve heard of stories of coal seam fires burning for a hundred years!  I checked out the internet and apparently there is a coal seam fire at Burning Mountain in Australia that has been burning for an estimated 6000 years! </p>

<p>James and I decided we would put out the fire, but have our lunch first.  We found a nice stump to sit on as we munched away on cheese and rice cakes, grapes and non-alcoholic beer.  As we ate, Chloe checked out the surroundings for any messages left by other critters, and then left a few herself.  She joined us for her doggie snack and to beg for some of ours.  We later perused the treed part of the campsite.</p>

<p>If Link River campsite has the brooding exoticness of an Emily Carr painting, the Pinch Creek site has it twice as much!   It is not as accessible as Link River.  One has to travel a little further down a logging road to get to it, or get to it by boat.  It seemed to have extra ferns, extra matted old man’s hairs hanging from the branches and less traces of human existence.  It was like a forgotten room in the back of an old house that is built up with cobwebs and dust.  And just like that forgotten room in the back of an old house, Pinch Creek seemed to have more than its fair share of spirits!  This was definitely the domain of beings who wanted to stay away from people! 
 After making use of the facilities in the form of a very beaten up, run down, leaning and very smelly outhouse that hadn’t been serviced probably in thirty years (It was so decrepit--it was kind of a novelty), we headed for the shore and our fire-fighting job.  We started by filling up our beer cans with lake water and pouring it on the fire.  That wasn’t getting anywhere very fast.  James then had an epiphany to use our bilge pumps.  He would figure that out, being that he is a pipe-fitter and all!  Even though the pumps carried a lot more water, it still took quite a lot of trips, perhaps a dozen or more, to put out that seemingly “itsy bitsy” smoldering campfire. </p>

<p>Having done a good 10 kilometres in 2 hours, we were done kayaking for the day and had a whole bunch of day left.  The long weekend crowds that were predicted did not transpire.  There weren’t many people around to mingle with and there was no tube to watch, so we buried our noses in our books.  James was reading <i>Absolute Power</i> by James Baldacci.  I was reading James A. Michener’s story of the Gold Rush called, <i>Journey</i>, and it was really pulling me a long.  Even though I am a writer, I’m not a fast reader and I can get easily distracted if a story isn’t interesting enough for me.  When I read, it is usually one chapter at a time, or even a couple of pages at a time.  I wasn’t having that problem with <i>Journey</i>.  I was really enjoyably lost in it, getting through more than half the book in a day. </p>

<p>Even though <i>Journey</i> was a lot of fun, it had some “plot holes” that bothered me.  I think that Michener has not spent a lot of time in the wilderness, as he seems to have missed out some crucial details of wilderness living…mosquitoes for one!  He mentions them in one area in the Yukon, but they should have been everywhere. When I was working in fire towers in Lac La Biche (not far from Athabasca Landing, a major launching point of the Gold Rush), I had to wear a sufficient amount of armor to protect myself from them when I went for walks in the evening.  Not only did I wear clothing to cover every bit of bare skin and my head, I had to douse myself with copious amounts of mosquito repellent on my face and head and even over my clothes!  Even with that, sometimes I had to wear mosquito netting and that didn’t even work!  With all this protection, the mosquito problem was only less, not eliminated…reduced to bearable!  If not properly protected, a person in the bush could easily die from mosquito and bug bites alone. </p>

<p>Another thing that bothered me was the lack of animal encounters.  The main characters spent years in the wilderness getting to their Gold Rush.  You cannot spend that much time out in the wilderness without having a significant amount of interaction with animals, not just with larger creatures like bear and moose, but also smaller ones like squirrels, beavers, ground hogs, etc.  Not only that, but they would have had to listen to the wolves and the coyotes howling on many a night, and it would have a certain effect on them.  His description made the north seem more like a void with trees.  I tend to see the forest as a bustling city with animals in it, with every square inch of territory claimed by some kind of critter, big or small.  The forest is private property, but, instead of being marked with stakes and fence lines, it is marked with pee.  Perhaps animals back then made themselves more invisible because they were at a high risk of becoming someone’s lunch.  Nevertheless, I find his depiction of the north to be very one-dimensional, as if the north is simply a back drop for human activity, rather than a mystical and alive world onto itself. </p>

<p>This is why I think it is so unfortunate that First Nations communities had to suffer through the residential school system.  The residential schools dismembered centuries of knowledge that the First Nations people had about the “engine of life” that is the forest.  The fact that so much information has been lost in the cultural genocide might prove disadvantageous for all of us sometime in the future. </p>

<p>For example:  lately, I’ve been getting into ethno botany.  I’ve been educating myself about herbs and foods that grow locally that First Nations people harvested back in the day.  Now, when I walk past forest vegetation, I see it very differently than I used to.  In the fall, James and I joined family for a gathering at Rupert Arm.  As soon as I got there I couldn’t help but notice a bunch of red clover for my arthritis, rose hips for colds and sea asparagus for making sea asparagus pickles and I set about picking.  I’m sure everybody thought I was a little odd, but they got used to it.  What others might see as just vegetation, I now see as a grocery and health food store!  This is very ironic, as many of the Gold Rush trekkers in Michener’s book suffered from scurvy and died from it.  Little did these scurvy sufferers realize that they were surrounded with the cure: spruce and pine needles are loaded with vitamin C!  They could have made a tea from them or ate them straight.  This is what likely happened in real life too: Gold Rushers died from scurvy while being literally surrounded by the antidote!  Anyone in the gold rush era who attempted to forage a connection with First Nations people probably had a leg up, and were the ones who survived and thrived. </p>

<p>I was struck with a bit of nostalgia when the book mentioned my home town “Athabasca Landing” or just “Athabasca.”  I always knew it had a close association with the Gold Rush.  I was surprised to discover just how much!  I was amazed at how so many footsteps from afar went through the sleepy little community that I grew up in. </p>

<p>I was taken aback by the fact that Michener mentioned a passenger train between Calgary and Edmonton.  I had never heard such a thing, although many bemoan the fact that there isn’t one between the two major cities in the present day.  There’s been a lot of talk about a high speed raised rail line between Calgary and Edmonton when I was living there, but so far, nothing has happened.  You would think if any two cities need a train between them, it would be Edmonton and Calgary.  They are the two main cities in the province, are relatively the same size, and have a lot of flat ground between them.  I checked it out and it looks like there actually was a passenger train between Calgary and Edmonton during the Gold Rush.  It looks as if there were several attempts to maintain train service along that route afterward, which were curtailed by the First World War and then by the popularity of the airplane and automobile.  One would think that, with global warming and infrastructure development being prominent issues of the day, perhaps an elevated solar and/or wind powered high speed train service between Edmonton and Calgary might finally come into fruition? </p>

<p>We kept reading until it got dark, then we pulled out our flashlights and read some more.  After retiring to out tent, the books still didn’t get put away. As Chloe snored away under a pile of blankets at our feet, we kept on reading for over an hour more before finally calling it quits on our day long readathon. </p>

<p><b>May 30, 2015</b></p>

<p>On Sunday we headed north, crossing Alice Lake on a diagonal.  James kept     complaining I was racing too far ahead.  When I slowed down, it made way for plenty of conversation about life.  We kept paddling for the longest time, but our destination did not seem to get too close too fast.  We were dealing with a lot of water, apparently, a lot more than we thought!  Finally, when the distance between our boats and the distant shore was finally bridged, we came upon the first of the hidden treasures we would come upon that day: a huge graveyard of driftwood!  Along the whole shore, from the east side of the lake to the point, which was maybe a good kilometre, there was driftwood everywhere.  Some of it was massive!  I could have spent hours and hours enjoying all the smooth voluminous shapes with strange twisty roots that looked like fallen imaginary monsters.  I also had the urge to save some of these pieces to make lamps and end tables, but there was no room on the kayaks!  I supposed we could have towed, but I was more interested in kayaking on further.  Chloe was snooping in all the nooks and crannies that served as protection for small critters and their stashes.  A couple of times she walked along some driftwood and found herself up too high up to get down on the ground and we had to provide her with some assistance. </p>

<p>We discovered some of the driftwood was carved with chain saws.  I started putting two and two together and realized this would be a good place for fire-fighters to “day base.”  When the fire hazard gets up there, a helicopter full of fire fighters flies out to a spot in the bush so they can be closer to a sensitive area should a fire break out.  This was probably an ideal spot to hang out for the day for fire-fighters trying to cope with the boredom of day-basing, hence why some of them got out their power saws and started trying to make art, or something, out of the driftwood.  We went a little further and discovered this was a well used base.  My presumption proved correct when, deep in the driftwood, we found the bare bones of a camp kitchen, about twenty by twenty feet square, constructed out of stumps.  It had a roof with some roofing paper on top, and counters with plywood tops. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post2-linkriver/campkitchen.jpg" alt="Camp Kitchen"><em>The camp kitchen.</em></p>

<p>All we had for taking pictures of the driftwood was my flip phone.  It was too bad, because taking photos of sculptural objects, I’d say, is my specialty.  James had a Galaxy 3 for taking pictures, but, for some reason, those photos went missing.  For this Link River trip, all we have are flip phone photos.  Many apologies for the low resolution images.  That will change.  We later upgraded our picture taking equipment to a higher definition camera phone, and are now looking to upgrade even more with a water resistant SLR camera.  When we get it, I think we are going to have make a special trip out to Driftwood Beach to take pictures. </p>

<p>After a snack and some pictures among the stumps, we took off around the point, hoping to get close to the island to the north.  That also seemed to take a long time too, even though it looked like it was quite close at first.  As we rounded the island we noticed something odd on the rocky shore of the lake.  It was a log tied to a tree beside a fire pit.  Going around the rocky outcrop we saw a weatherworn dock.  I wanted to keep going but James was more curious.   Still feeling a little awkward in the kayak, I thought it would be hard to get into our kayaks from that dock.  I suggested to James to go ahead and check things out.  He came back saying “you’ve got to see this.”  We docked our kayaks, tying them to any lose rope we could find on the ramshackle pier. </p>

<p>I wondered what could have possibly got him so excited.  After I pulled myself up the steep narrow path through the Salal, there it was in all its rugged glory:  a cabin!  James told me he had heard of cabins like this interspersed through the bush.  They are built on crown land, so no one actually owns them even though they have had a lot of effort and expense put into building them.  This cabin was built with two by fours, plywood and cedar planks on a foundation of logs embedded into the ground.  It had a covered front porch and a leaning outhouse a ways away.  There was a sign on the door written in pencil, welcoming us in.  We were told we could make use of the cabin and the items inside, but to keep it cleaner than when we arrived and replace anything we used.  Inside there was a wood stove, a picnic table and lighting in the form of candles and kerosene lamps.  There were roughshod counters with Rubbermaid totes underneath.  One was filled with pots, pans, dishes and utensils, and another was filled with board games.  There was an old sofa from the seventies or eighties and a guest book that was filled to the brim with comments made by its visitors that went back as far as 1995.  It was quite possible that the people who originally built this cabin hadn’t seen it in a good long while.  There were two levels of beds built into the wall with a ladder for getting up to the higher one.  There was an emergency supply of toilet paper hanging from the middle of the ceiling on a rope, to be kept from being devoured by rats and mice. </p>

<p>James and I sat down and had our snack and read through some of the guest book.  Since it was at the end, we vowed that the next time we came, we’d bring a new one.  We wanted to stay there and spend the night, but I had lunch supervisor duty the next day.  We followed a trail down to the fire pit we saw from the water, imagining what it would be like to be sitting around a campfire under the stars.  We proclaimed it very lovely and definitely a future destination. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/post2-linkriver/inthecabin.jpg" alt="Insdie the Cabin"><em>Inside the cabin.</em></p>

<p>We didn’t have too much difficulty getting into our boats from the dock.  You just have to walk on your hands and slip your keister down.  We paddled around the island.  I got disoriented and James had to straighten me out and make me go in the right direction.  Thank God he stopped me or we might have ended up going down Marble River!  Going back, with the sun coming out, it made the water a very intense blue.  With the Merry Widow in the background another lovely hue of blue, we took numerous pictures of it with James’ phone which are now lost forever!  After spending so much time out-paddling James, at the last stretch going home, he out-paddled me.  He left me in the dust (or the splash), with my paddling getting continually weaker and weaker.  He got his second wind and my wind was out!  We estimated that we kayaked a total of 12 kilometres that day.  For the whole weekend I kayaked 25 kilometres and James did close to 30!  Not bad for first timers!</p>

<p>So an over-aged boy scout, a retired Smokey the Bear and a kayaking Chihuahua had their first official kayaking outing!  I’m surprised by how our little neighbourhood recreational retreat turned out to be such an adventure.  Stay tuned folks!  There will be many more adventures to come!</p>

	  <title>Welcome to Port Alice: A Kayaker’s Paradise</title>

	     <p>Hello, my name is Debra Lynn.  I live in Port Alice with my partner, James, two cats named Pepper and Mr. Magoo, and an adorable little Chihuahua named Chloe.  Port Alice is a village with a population of 500 situated at the northern end of Vancouver Island.   In one respect it is your average small remote BC town with bare bones amenities of a grocery store, a gas station, a convenience store, a campsite, a hotel, a Royal Canadian Legion, a library and a thrift store.  Not much happens, life moves slowly and everybody knows everybody.  Port Alice was a much larger town once upon a time -- with a population nearing 2000 -- in its heyday in the seventies when the mill was going strong.  Now the mill, almost a century old, is having trouble competing in the new millennium.  It went through a series of curtailments since the eighties and eventually declared bankruptcy in 2004.  Shortly after getting new owners in 2011, it went into a production curtailment with no real promise of getting back to full service anytime soon.  The town has emptied out, and those who are left have to work out of town, even out of province.  A lot of people are down in the dumps, missing the days when half the population had whopping big paycheques.  It’s as if the town has become “Nowheresville” to many of the residents.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post1-welcome/debnjames.jpg" alt="JamesandMe"><em>James and me</em></p>

<p>In another respect, Port Alice is a gem—a potential tourist hotspot like Banff or Jasper.  When you see the view driving into town, you can’t help but gasp as the beauty of it….even if you’ve lived here for a few years!  Nestled in a mountain side on the shores of the Neroutsos Inlet, practically every house in the village has a “million dollar view.”  Although there is the mill, it is 5 kms from town and very much out of sight.  Close to the east shore of the inlet is a grouping of islands called the Frigon Islands that remind me of those famous photos of Spirit Island on Maligne Lake in the Rocky Mountains.  It is not uncommon to have a bear or even a cougar walk through town.  An eagle flying overhead is an everyday occurrence.  If you go down to the water, chances are you will have a close encounter with some kind of aquatic life, whether it be birds, a seal, a sea lion, a sea otter, even an orca or a humpback whale!  Look into the water from the dock and watch schools of fish, crab, starfish and jellyfish going about their business.  If you happen to be into kayaking, call Port Alice paradise!   </p>

<p>Not only can residents like ourselves hop into our kayaks from the shore of the town for a paddle in majestic scenery and natural wonders, but the surrounding area holds a multitude of potential kayaking adventures.  You can take the logging roads to the Wild West Coast and visit pristine sights like Side Bay, Gooding Cove, Harvey Cove, Brooks Peninsula and Klaskino Inlet to name a few. Visitors and traffic to those areas are so infrequent and they look so untouched that, when you get there, you might feel like you discovered them!  Cradled in the mountains and a short drive from Port Alice are Alice Lake and Victoria Lake, with a well maintained campsite at Link River that joins the two bodies of water.  The Neroutsos Inlet is a south branching arm of the Quastsino Sound.  Looking at my map of the Quatsino Sound on my wall, I see enough coves, inlets and islands that would take many life times to explore!  At the end of the sound is the Quatsino Narrows leading into the Holberg Inlet.  A little larger than Neroutsos Inlet, it too has enormous potential for kayaking exploration.  On the Port Hardy side of the island there are places like Storey’s Beach for an easy paddle and God’s Pocket Provincial Marine Park for the more ambitious kayaker.  In the Port McNeill area are the Broughton and Johnstone Straits—popular areas for whale watching.  To the south of Port McNeill is a grouping of lakes, including Nimpkish Lake and Huson Lake with the Little Huson Lake Cave Regional Park.  These places are but a few examples where the possibilities for kayaking adventures are virtually endless!</p>

<p>I came to Port Alice in 2010, to get away from crowds and cities and focus on my writing.  I ended up buying a very cheap fixer-upper condominium, paying about a quarter of the price of a similar house in any other part of the country.   Even though the interior of the house was a seventies decore eye-sore, I was sold on the long balcony with an ocean and mountain view!   In 2013, I self-published my first children’s picture book, Marshmallow, and have started illustrating a second picture book.  I met my partner, James, in 2014 even though we had both been living here since 2010.  At a darts tournament at the Legion the gods were up to something, as we got paired up as a couples’ team from names drawn out of a hat.  We didn’t get into the finals, but I did win a turkey for highest women’s score and then we scored each other’s phone numbers and the rest is history.  Both James and I have always been quite active throughout our lives.  We both contemplated getting into kayaking at some point in the past but never got around to it.  Although I’ve worked as a forest fire lookout for 18 years and am pretty brazen about trudging through the bush by myself, being that I was a “prairie chicken” (ie. from Alberta), I didn’t think I had enough “ocean instincts” to kayak on my own.  Not long after meeting each other, we plunked down some money for a couple of second-hand kayaks and started paddling like we knew what we were doing.  </p>

<p>When I met James I didn’t just get one kayaking partner, I got two!  He insisted his little Chihuahua, Chloe, had to come with us.  We even bought a tandem kayak with a special seat for her!  When I was first introduced to Chloe, with her big eyes and big pointy ears, I gave her the nick-name “Ferbie.”  I have to admit, though I am an avid dog lover, I wasn’t crazy about Chihuahuas.  When I was a kid, my cousins had a Chihuahua that wasn’t very friendly.  Plus, Chloe didn’t have a lot of fur and had funny big ears and a little curled up nose that made her look like a bat.  It wasn’t long, though, before she became the cutest dog in the world to me!  She is not so much a dog, but more like a human child.  She can sit in our laps and be carried around like a baby.  She is hungry for attention, is prone to jealousy, hides behind us whenever she is scared and is psychically tuned to our moods.  Since James and I are past the age for having babies, Chloe has become our baby.  Some words in English she knows very well are “walk” and, especially, “car ride,”  and lately, “kayak” to which she responds by pointing her ears up like a couple of antennae and tilting her head inquisitively.  When she isn’t walking, car riding or kayaking, she likes to curl up inside a blanket and sleep.  She is very skilled at lifting a blanket with her nose, crawling under it and then turning around inside it, making a little mushroom cap shaped tent for herself.  Because she has short hair and a Mexican heritage, she is always trying to stay warm.  For some reason, she barks whenever the cats try to claw the furniture (even though she has never been trained to do so), earning her the title of “furniture police.”  She gets a long fine with the cats and the cats get along fine with her, but only to a point.  She has her “personal space.”  If the cats get too close, she gives them a little growl.  Once Chloe and Mr. Magoo got too close to each other when I was in the kitchen and it produced the strangest combination cat/Chihuahua noise I ever heard!  Once Pepper tried to lie across Chloe, but Chloe let her know in no uncertain terms that she was not a cat bed!  Lately, however, I’ve noticed Chloe allowing the cats get close enough to her so that they are almost snuggling.  Although she is smaller than one of our cats, Chloe thinks she is a guard dog.  The pint sized pooch barks at anyone who walks by with real guard dog authority, making the perceived intruders laugh hysterically.  </p>

<p>So we are fifty-something new kayakers with a Chihuahua set out to explore our incredibly beautiful back yard.  Since writing is my thing, I thought I’d share our experiences with you, perhaps giving you some ideas for your own out-of-the-way vacation adventures.  Although tourism is not without an environmental impact, I believe that getting to know all these beautiful nooks and crannies that exist in nature can teach us more respect and reverence for Mother Earth, and make us more inclined to take better care of her.  Although the real solutions for our environmental problems await us sometime in the future, we need to become familiar with and appreciate the beautiful spiritual domains that exist outside our city limits to get the process started.  </p>

<p>I think there are more tourist gems in our country than the general population is aware of.  I was a world traveler in my younger day, traveling to China, Japan, Mexico, the US and Europe.  I’ve met countless people from these crowded polluted countries who dream of experiencing the serenity and ruggedness of places like Canada.  Never mind oil and gas.  I think the millions of square kilometres of our relatively untouched nature are our most viable economic resource.   </p>

<p>The entries into this blog of our 2015 kayaking trips will be entered in belatedly.  I kept notes of our kayaking, but we faced a bit of a learning curve when it came to making a blog.  After some research, and help form my computer programmer son, we got it figured out.  Once we get caught up and submit all of our 2015 stories, we hope to add future entires shortly after each of our expeditions.  </p>
